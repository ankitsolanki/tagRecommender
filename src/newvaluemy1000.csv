"1","How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?","<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>

<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

"2","How can I prevent firefox from closing when I press ctrl-w","<p>In my favorite editor (vim), I regularly use ctrl-w to execute a certain action. Now, it quite often happens to me that firefox is the active window (on windows) while I still look at vim (thinking vim is the active window) and press ctrl-w which closes firefox. This is not what I want. Is there a way to stop ctrl-w from closing firefox?</p>

I figure since the code already works for WP7, it should be a matter of mostly copying and pasting it for the C# code behind. </p>

I just need to figure out how to fetch the page, I assume the parsing will be the same as on my phone app. Any help?</p>

<p>Context: I'm creating some tree graph plotting software and testing it by using multi-digit random numbers (so each digit becomes a node in the tree). The random number generator I've been using - which is the one that comes with the GNU C++ compiler - gives me a nice spread of values. That's good, but I want to see how the table looks when the numbers clump together and are less homogenous. </p>

"16","PHP framework URL conventions","<p>A lot of frameworks use URL conventions like <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> which is great, but if you need any configuration beyond that, it's up to you to write your own routes.</p>

<p>How would you handle URLs like <code>/users/{id}/friends</code> on the backend? (to list all of a user's friends)</p>

<p>I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>class User {
    function index() {
        echo 'user index';
    }
}

class Friend extends User {
    function index($user_id) {
        echo 'friend index';
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have the following map:</p>

<pre><code>/users              -&gt; User::index()
/users/{id}         -&gt; User::view($id)
/users/{id}/friends -&gt; Friend::index($user_id)
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts?</p>

<p>What URL would use for editing your list of friends? <code>/users/{id}/friends/edit</code> could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would <code>/account/friends/edit</code> be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller?</p>

<p>Bonus question: which do you prefer? <code>/photos/delete/{id}</code> or <code>/photos/{id}/delete</code></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>The answers:</strong></p>

<p>So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the ""thing"" is complicated (like ""friends"") but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with.</p>

<p>No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's ""awkward"". Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers :)</p>

<hr>

<p>I ran across the movie <a href=""http://cutpoisonburn.com/"">Cut Poison Burn</a>, who's abstract is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cut Poison Burn is a controversial, eye opening, and sometimes heartbreaking documentary that puts the business of cancer treatment under the microscope. Follow the frustrating journeys of critically ill cancer patients as they try to navigate the confusing and dangerous maze of treatment and encounter formidable obstacles in the “cancer industrial complex.”  A compelling critique of the influence of medical monopolies, the power of pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, Cut Poison Burn is essential viewing for anyone and everyone touched by cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie may advocate (haven't watched the whole thing) some kind of new, pennies-per-session treatment a la <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4611/does-burzynski-have-a-miracle-cancer-cure-being-suppressed-by-the-fda"">Burzynski</a>, or at least <a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/19/cut-poison-burn.aspx"">Dr. Mercola is using it to do so</a>.</p>

<p>There are a myriad of claims in the movie, I'm sure (I only watched the first 10min), but I'd like to address one in particular that struck me (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/26874089"">occurs starting at the 7min mark</a>). It is made by Charles B. Simone, M.MS, M.D., founder of the <a href=""http://www.drsimone.com/center.htm"">Simone Protective Cancer Center</a> (transcripted by me; may contain small errors):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From 1920 to the present time, we have made little or no progress in the treatment of adult cancers. So a person who gets prostate cancer or breast cancer today will live as long as a person who got it in 1920. No big change. With all the radiation therapy that began in the 10's and 20's, combination chemotherapy in the 60's, immunotherapy that began in the 70's, PET scans, MRI scans, you name it, billions and billions and billions of research dollar that we've thrown into this whole area of cancer research and treatment... little or no significant progress in the treatment of adult cancers.</p>

<p>Is this the case? Has no treatment since 1920 done anything to increase the chance of [long-term] survival of adults who have cancer?</p>

I'd like to know if this is the best approach.</p>

<p>Example enumeration:
<pre><code>[Flags]
enum Status {
  None = 0x0,
  Active = 0x1,
  Inactive = 0x2,
  Canceled = 0x4,
  Suspended = 0x8
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>The extension method that converts the set flags to array of int that I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public static class Extensions
{
    public static int[] ToIntArray(this System.Enum o) 
    {
        return o.ToString()
            .Split(new string[] { "", "" }, StringSplitOptions.None)
            .Select(i => (int)Enum.Parse(o.GetType(), i))
            .ToArray();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This is how I use it:</p>

<pre><code>Status filterStatus = Status.Suspended | Status.Canceled;

int[] filterFlags = filterStatus.toIntArray();

foreach (int flag in filterFlags) {
   Console.WriteLine(""{0}\n"", flag);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will output:</p>

<pre><code>4
8</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, to get this done I'm doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Converting the variable to string. It outputs something like: Suspended, Canceled</li>
<li>Splitting that string into an array of strings: { ""Suspended"", ""Canceled"" }</li>
<li>Converting that string to the enumeration value with Enum.Parse.</li>
<li>Casting the value to an integer.</li>
<li>Converting the IEnumerable to int[].</li>
</ol>

<p>It works, but I just don't think it's the best approach. Any suggestions to improve this bit of code?</p>

The makefile contains the path to the compiler as well as the path to all the files that could possibly be used in the compiling operation. The MAKE application reads the makefile and combines the sources into 1 file which the compiler then reads and converts into the relevant assembly/machine code.</p>

<p>The #include directive is a directive that tells the make file to:
""include the contents of this file into this point of the larger file that you're making to feed to the compiler then resume with the current file"".</p>

<p>The MAKE application also tells the compiler where to ""emit"" the result of the compile operation once the compiling is completed. In this regard a Visual Studio .csproj file is technically a XML based makefile for a Microsoft specific MAKE application.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except that I want to stick with MVC's own bundling if I can. I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.</p>

<p>I have a typical MVC site structure with <code>/Content/css/</code> which contains my base CSS such as <code>styles.css</code>. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as <code>/jquery-ui</code> which contains its CSS file plus an <code>/images</code> folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them.</p>

<p>As I understand it, when I specify a <code>StyleBundle</code> I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying:</p>

<pre><code>bundles.Add( 
    new StyleBundle(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")
        .Include(""~/Content/css/jquery-ui/*.css""));
</code></pre>

<p>rendered using:</p>

<p><code>@Styles.Render(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")</code></p>

<p>I can see the request going out to:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/jquery-ui?v=nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1</code></p>

<p>This is returning the correct minified CSS response. 
But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png</code></p>

<p>Which is a <code>404</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that the last part of my URL <code>jquery-ui</code> is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply <code>/styles/images/</code>. </p>

<p>So my question is <strong>what is the correct way</strong> of handling this situation? </p>

I'm already a month late on my mortgage and this really isn't helping my situation.  I've been working on fixing this intermittent load problem for months (never this bad). </p>

<p>I'm suspecting some kind of attack since I'm under DDOS attack a lot!  I've been trying to figure out what is causing the load but I'm afraid I just don't have the experience or knowledge to understand all the data I've been looking at.  I don't even know where to begin or how to test for the large array of attacks out there.</p>

<p>Here's some data you might find useful...</p>

<p>Server:  Xeon X3220 Quad Core 2.4 GHz - Linux, FreeBSD 500 GB HD and 8 Gig of Ram.  Runs Centos release 5.7

<p>Warning:  All sites are softcore adult sites - mostly fantasy art like elves and amazons.</p>

<p>1)  Sites may run fine for weeks or just days at less than 10 load then start jumping to 40-80 load - no idea why.  Same sites, same mods, same amount of traffic - just WHAM!</p>

<p>2) I get an email almost every day that says:  ""Large Number of Failed Login Attempts from IP (different each time)"".  My webhost (who almost never helps me) told me it was a udp flood or something.</p>

<p>3) I've changed the port for MySQL from the default.  If I ever put it back to the default - I get Loads of over 100 from what must be a constant mysql port flood.</p>

<p>4)  I've reconfigured MYSQL.  Link:  <a href=""http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt</a></p>

<p>5) I have 3 Joomla Jomsocial networks.  I've spent a couple weeks turning all the mods/plugins off, waiting a day and then turning them back on the next day or later if there isn't any change (there hasn't been).  For example, on Thursday I'll turn off videos, on Friday I'll turn off chat.. etc and nothing changes the load appreciably.   </p>

<p>6) Joomla info:  All SEF turned off - sh404sef completely disabled and removed.  Components: Joomla 1.5.22, Jomsocial 2.0.5, Kunena 1/31/2011, HWDMediashare 11/22/2010  and JBolo Chat 2.7.3, Comet Chat or Envolve Chat.   Page Compression is on, Cache is on 15 mins.  </p>

<p>Hi guys
I'm back with some more info about my poor server.  The server is currently limping along with a load of between 20 and 60 averaging about 30.</p>

<p>I'll add an incentive to solving my problem: $100 via Paypal for an answer that solves the 'load' problem without the suggestion of buying 1 or more extra servers.  Again, these sites worked fine with even higher traffic on a lower powered server.</p>

<p>I just recompiled apache 2.22 adding eaccelerator and zend-optimizer - no change.  The other mod I included was QOS which keeps the # of connections at a lower level.  I've had QOS working for awhile.</p>

<p>Yes I did turn off the port to MySQL I should've mentioned that.</p>

   $(this).attr('title', song_title);
   $(this).attr('alt', ""This works everytime""); 
   });
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>Now the above works but only when I ""stop"" the process by adding in the unwanted alert - I can only guess that the code is executing before it has retrieved the data from the JSON call (?) and the alert enables it to catch up.</p>

<p>I imagine I need another function that executes after the JSON call or for the code to go into the 'success' function but I'm not sure how to keep hold of the 'this' element if that is the case.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make a status bar notification to the user (i.e. Notification / NotificationManager) from the kernel? </p>

<p>A similar functionality I'm trying to achieve is like connecting to the phone via USB. When the phone detects a USB connection, a status bar notification is produced (and if debugging is enabled, it will tell you that too). How is this done? At some point the kernel sends a signal, but how is the notification generated?</p>

<p>The approach I'm going to try and implement is using the NDK. Create a library that listens/waits for a signal from my LKM, then use then create an app that's just a background service that notifies when the signal is received. </p>

<p>Is there a more elegant solution for this? And I'd like to not have to recompile the AOSP. </p>

"58","SSRS limit length of text but keep full words","<p>In my table I have essentially 2 columns (many more but there is an obvious left side and right side). One of the fields, FIELD1, on the left side comes from a LookupSet() and each ID can have two items from FIELD1. Using a join(lookupset(), vbcrlf) I am able to get both values for the ID and put it into one cell in the table. This works but with the vbcrlf, the row height is increased. This causes a problem because there is data on the right side which cannot have additional space between it.</p>

<p>I did a split(join(lookupset())).getValue(0) for the first row and then the row below it for value 1. With some iif statements to check errors etc, this works.</p>

<p>One problem I solved is that the values for FIELD1 can be longer than the width of the cell, but will not take up more than two. I was able to do some substring magic in oracle like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 1, 70) FROM....
UNION
SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 70) FROM ...
</code></pre>

<p>using sorting, I am able to get up to 4 rows of data per ID which I will be able to split the lookupset and get each value into the table.</p>

<p>My last problem, and hopefully someone can help with is that when I ge the substring, It can cut off words and the next row will start with the rest of the word.
Is there a way, possibly using a regex to make sure to keep words in tact, but also to ensure that the total length returned is &lt; some number of characters? I am happy to abandon any part of the approach i am currently taking if I am off track.</p>

<p>Alright so the size of the backup is getting bigger and bigger every day. So I need a way to backup better.</p>

<p>I'd like some suggestions on how to do this.</p>

<p>But what I was thinking was that every 3 days the third day backups are deleted. But one is kept. </p>

<p>This would mean that my backup total is 73.5gb after 3 days of backups. Then I want to keep that third day backup for 1 week. So on the 10th day it is deleted. So about 85gb of total data is backed up.</p>

<p>Ever hour for 2 days and then 1 hour from every day after that 8 times.</p>

<p>I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be move that 1 hour backup from the third day to a new folder and have a separate script for it that is run daily. However I am not sure how I would go about picking out one of them out from the others and how to delete the ones older than 2 days. </p>

<p>I would likely run these scripts as cronjobs and set them to daily.</p>

<p>I use centOS 64bit 5.7, any tips would be great....incremental backups are NOT an option.</p>

<p>Also, is there an easy way to sync my home PC to a website to download the newest file on there at a particular time? I want this for the backups. I've seen some nice php webpages where it makes a simple filemanager to download files from...perhaps something like this?  </p>

<p>If the JSfiddle link doesn't give you the results I'm describing, then copy and paste the code below into a fresh jsfiddle and try the same experiment. Doing it this way ensures for me that the observe will not work. Regardless of the way it's applied in my application it refuses to observe the keystrokes.</p>

"78","Creating variables with index (using counters)","<p>Is there a way to add an index to a command? For example:</p>

<pre><code>\newcounter{count}
\loop&lt;condition&gt;
  \def\var\Roman{count}{some data}
\repeat
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>\var\Roman{count}</code> should become the variable <code>\varI</code>, <code>\varII</code>, <code>\varIII</code> and so on.</p>

<p>Background: I need to get some data from external files and store it into variables (which I will later use to create a document). Normally every <code>\varI</code> should be the same as every <code>\varII</code>, but I need to check whether it really is the case or not. If not I should return a warning or error.</p>

<hr>

<p>Solution for the first problem is in the comments, but I have a second problem.</p>

<p>Suppose I wrote this:</p>

<pre><code>\newcommand\addindex[3]{  % #1 as name of var, #2 as index and #3 as content
  \expandafter\def\csname #1\Roman{#2}\endcsname{#3}  % thanks to egreg
}

\newcounter{count}
\loop\unless\ifnum\value{count}=5
  \stepcounter{count}
  \addindex{var}{count}{\arabic{count}}
\repeat
</code></pre>

<p>All <code>\var&lt;index&gt;</code> have now as value 5, because they are defined as <code>\arabic{count}</code>, and not their value at the moment. Adding <code>\expandafter</code> before <code>\arabic{count}</code> does not seem to work for some reason...</p>

"79","Mercurial hooks: how to find the current directory on commit","<p>I am trying to create a hook to Mercurial SCM (hg) using C# .NET, to launch a custom C# application on commit or pre-commit.</p>

<p>As a proof-of-concept prototype, I added a location of my custom .exe to the Mercurial.ini file's [hooks] section for pre-commit, and another .exe for commit.
Those .exe apps open on pre-commit and commit, as expected.</p>

<p>However, those executables are only stubs so far.
To make them do what I need, they have to ""know"" the current directory where the commit is about to occur (or has occurred).
Mercurial.ini is located in my user profile directory on Windows.
For example, when I do a commit from an Hg repository located in C:\MyProjects\TestProject, the executables need to know that the work is being done in C:\MyProjects\TestProject.</p>

<p>How can I find out programmatically at runtime from a ""hooked"" executable where the Mercurial command is being executed on the local machine?</p>

Any perspectives on using Ruby and Savon versus Java and Axis? </p>

<p>With Ruby/Savon, it seems that the best thing to do is to skip using the WSDL files and generate the requests based on examples from the Java/Axis program. I tried using the WSDL feature of Savon, but I could not get it to work with the many embedded types and namespaces in the very complex WSDLs.</p>

<p>Looking at the Java/Axis code, there's a huge amount of generated code that isolates the Java developer from knowing about the XML. Has anybody ever tried to replicate Axis in the Ruby world?</p>

<h1>Simple approach that did not work</h1>

<p>(Please note: <code>lsregister</code> can be found under <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister</code>).</p>

<p>Currently I am using the output of <code>lsregister -dump | grep -E '^.*[ \\t]*path:[ \\t]+(\/.*)$' | grep -Eo '\/.*'</code>, which has a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.app</code> bundles with newlines (<code>\n</code>, which is valid on UNIX) are not handled correctly (This issue would be fixable by writing a proper parser)</li>
<li><p><code>lsregister</code> doesn't handle correctly weird filename (e.g. containing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_mark"" rel=""nofollow"">RTL mark</a>). <code>lsregister</code> just seems to ignore files with the RTL mark in their name. 
If you want to, you can create a file with RTL in its name by running the following command.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'import shutil; shutil.copytree(u""/Applications/TextEdit.app"", u""/Applications/ThisIsAWeird\u202EApp.app"")'
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, <code>lsregister -dump | grep ThisIsAWeird</code> will <em>not</em> reveal it. But when you right click on a text file and go to ""Open With"" you'll that LaunchServices and Finder still support that file.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/c40Jq.png"" alt=""see yourself""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Simply enumerating all files in <code>/Applications</code> and other directories does not work because LaunchServices is aware of application bundles in arbitrary folders and I also need these apps.</p>

<h1>Other approch that I didn't get to work</h1>

<p>Apparently, there's a private API function called <code>_LSFindApplications</code> which does exactly what I need to do but I can't get it to work and didn't find any inofficial documentation on the internet. (proof it exists: <code>nm /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/LaunchServices  | grep __LSFindApplications$</code>)</p>

<p>I did a lot of thesting and found out that the access to the BlockingCollection bcPort seems to be the problem. bcPort gets constantly chunks from another data-adder thread which is also supposed not to influnce the ui thread. So I dont understand the following:</p>

<p>1.) Why is the GUI getting stuck when I am using different threads for adding and 
packaging the chunks?</p>

<p>2.) Why is this happening when I am using a BC for storing data? Arent these thread safe collections for this certain purpose?</p>

<p>By the way: Windows 7 ResourceManager shows 100% CPU usage during streaming, the chunks contain about 2000 float values each, 4 or 5 of them a rushing in per second. I also disabled the Logger but no effect. The consumer and evaluation threads are disabled. </p>

<p>Besides the ui thread, there is only a thread called ""ReceiveAndSave"" which makes chunks out of incoming float vals (see code, Method ""Add""). the thread ""Producer"" is doing some further packaging and enqeues the chunks for the consumer (deactivated). </p>

"108","Tough routing problem with Linux, Quagga and OpenVPN","<h2>The Setup</h2>

<p>I have an OpenVPN server that acts as a central router. It is configured with ""topology subnet"" command. Clients are Debian Linux nodes and each have one (or more) subnets directly connected to them.</p>

<p>The objective is for any client connected to the VPN to be able to access the subnets connected behind each other client.</p>

<p>In order to spread the routing information, we have installed Quagga on the clients and on the server. This works fine using the OSPF daemon. Routing is enabled on all the clients and the server as well.</p>

<h2>Routing table</h2>

<p>The routing table on the server is the following :</p>

<pre><code>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

</code></pre>

<p>The subnet I want to access is 192.168.100.0/24. The gateway in question responds perfectly fine and I can connect to it alright.</p>

<p>I don't think this will be of any use but here is part of the client routing table :</p>

<pre><code>10.2.10.1       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 tun0

192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
</code></pre>

<h2>Where things start going south</h2>

<p>Pinging from the server (10.8.0.1) to any hosts (including the VPN client interface) in the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet fails. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN client, I see no relevant package. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN server, I see the package in question being sent out.</p>

<p>The real edgy thing is that when I traceroute to a valid IP in the 192.168.100.0 subnet, it doesn't discover any hops (there should be just one). If I traceroute directly to the next hop (10.8.0.4), it responds fine.</p>

<p>I really hope I am being clear as this is quite a complex problem. I'll be happy to provide extra information at your request.</p>

I'm trying to figure out a good solution that won't take several months to develop but will still provide good flexibility for future enhancements.</p>

<p>My options I believe are:</p>

<pre><code>cms+e-commerce plugin (e.g. drupal+ubercart)
e-commerce platform that is extendable (e.g. magento)
framework+e-commerce platform (e.g. ci+magento)

</code></pre>

<p>The site will be similar to etsy where users can have items that they sell with their own portfolio page. The client wants to add many custom features as well. Also, the site will serve up a lot of images and audio.</p>

<p>I'm concerned that using strictly a e-commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart+framework. I know Magento is written on Zend, but while I have used Magento, I'm not very familiar with Zend and it seems to take quite a while to learn.</p>

<p>I have never used ubercart,wp e-commerce, or virtuemart, so I'm not sure of the limitations. The products will not need to be configurable. But we will need to store financial information. I'm thinking braintree's vault or authorize.net cim.</p>

<p>I'd like to do the framework+ecommerce platform route. But the client would also like a lower price option, I'm leaning towards drupal+ubercart.</p>

I created a .csv file with MATLAB of a sine wave at 440 Hz, and at first I had sampled it at 1 KHz (for 1 second).</p>

<p>My C++ program would then load that file and send the buffer to the soundcard. The problem is that the output was distorted (clipped), and didn't sound like a sine wave at all. Then I thought, maybe the sound card doesn't like 1 kHz sampling rates, so I doubled it, and suddenly everything was fine.</p>

<pre><code>    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking for a way to query if for example F is a descendant of A (note: F doesn't need to be a <strong>direct</strong> descendant of F), which, in this particular case would be true. Only a limited amount of potential parent nodes need to be tested against a larger potential descendants node pool.</p>

<p>UPDATE: when testing whether a node is a descendant of a node in the potential parent pool, it needs to be tested against ALL potential parent nodes.</p>

<p>This is what a came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Convert multiway tree to a trie, i.e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree:</p>

<pre><code> A = 1
 B = 11
 C = 12
 D = 111
 E = 112
 F = 121
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i.e. if C is added to the potential parent node pool, do:</p>

<pre><code>  1    2    3  &lt;- Prefix length

*[1]  [1]  ...
 [2] *[2]  ...
 [3]  [3]  ...
 [4]  [4]  ...
 ...  ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first ""prefix array"" (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second ""prefix array"" and so on, i.e. testing F leads to:</p>

<pre><code> F = 1    2    1

   *[1]  [1]  ...
    [2] *[2]  ...
    [3]  [3]  ...
    [4]  [4]  ...
    ...  ...
</code></pre>

<p>so yes F, is a descendant of C.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This test seems to be worst case O(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern.</p>

<p>Is there another way for doing that? Any pointers greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Right now I'm setting shaders using <code>D3DXCreateEffectFromFile</code> calls, which create shaders in runtime <em>(once per each shader)</em> from <code>*.fx</code> files.</p>

<p><em>Rendering part for every object (<strong>every patch in my case - see further</strong>) then means something like:</em></p>

<pre><code>// --------------------
// Preprocessing
effect-&gt;Begin();
effect-&gt;BeginPass(0);
effect-&gt;SetMatrix (or Vector or whatever - internal shader parameters) (...)
effect-&gt;CommitChanges();

// --------------------
// Geometry rendering

// Pass the geometry to render
// ...

// --------------------
// Postprocessing

// End 'effect' passes
effect-&gt;EndPass();
effect-&gt;End();
</code></pre>

<p>This is okay, but the profiler shows weird things - <strong><code>preprocessing</code></strong> <em>(see code)</em> takes about 60% of time <em>(I'm rendering terrain object of 256 patches where every patch contains about 10k vertices)</em>.</p>

<p>Actual geometry rendering takes ~35% and postprocessing - 5% of total rendering time.</p>

<p>This seems pretty strange to me and I guess that <code>D3DXEffect</code> interface may not be the best solution for this sort of things. </p>

<p><strong>I've got 2 questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Do I need to implement my own shader controller / wrapper (probably, low-level) and where should I start from?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Would compiling shaders help to somehow improve parameter setting performance?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe somebody knows how to solve this kind of problem / some implemented shader interface or could give some advices about how is this kind of problem solved in modern game engines.</p>

"132","Pipelining within Process Groups","<p>I'm currently reading Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens/Rago.</p>

<p>Within the process group section of the book, the author discusses how process groups are utilized commonly by shells for pipelining.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the argument shown below could have been generated by
  shell commands of the form:</p>
  
  <p>proc1 | proc2 &amp; proc3 | proc4 | proc5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining. However, the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented.</p>

<p>I know that in Linux shells like Boune-again shell (BASH), processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel -- that is, in the previous example showing <code>proc3 | proc4 | proc5</code>, all three of these processes are simultaneously executed. The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3. (I also know that MS-DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel, but let's ignore that for the moment).</p>

<p>So, I've got proc3, proc4, proc5 all in a process group. Fantastic. How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create N-1 pipelines, where N is the number of processes in the
pipelined statement fork() the shell process N times</li>
<li>In each forked process, I need to use dup2 to properly set up the
shared pipelines</li>
<li>Then, after all of the forked processes have confirmation that they
have all finalized setting up their pipes (likely via some IPC via a
shared memory space), each can then run exec() and actually launch
their respective processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, all of the texts which I keep reading act as if process groups provide some magical functionality to create these pipelines -- or they are simply neglecting to mention the procedure I outlined above.</p>

<p>Any comments or advice is always appreciated.</p>

I need the form to populate drop downs from both of the tables with existing values so that the user may select them and create an entry. So far i havent had much luck in this.</p>

CmsGroupModel cmsGroupList = new CmsGroupModel();
model.addAttribute(""cmsAttribute"", cmsAttribute);
return ""/cmsattribute_submit"";
}

<pre><code> AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions {
UpdateTargetId = ""tabledata"",
Url = Url.Action(""AppointmentData"")
};
</code></pre>

<p>And than just passing this ""ajaxOpts"" into the Ajax.BeginForm() I am unable to store the ajax options in a variable and than pass that into Ajax.ActionLink. Please see the syntax I am attempting below:</p>

AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""catlist-"" + Model.Count,

new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""catlist-"" + Model.Count,  
})

<p>It's understandable that when you don't specify the URL for the form and instead just use AjaxOptions as a parameter and jscript is turned off the form will just by default post back to the Action that rendered the page. But is something similar possible for the ActionLink ?  </p>

I measured timings for operations in <code>onCreate</code> method and discovered that more than one second was spent for <code>setContentView(R.layout.main_screen);</code>
I prefer to show previous screen (in my case Splash screen) instead of this black screen during <code>setContentView</code> execution. <strong>How can I rid off this black screen?</strong></p>

<p>Seems android in some way preloads layouts and such problems occurs sometimes. But if I kill my process and start app I always see this black screen.</p>

"161","How to enable windows authentication through a reverse proxy?","<p>Sorry if it is a duplicate, as I am not a security nor network expert I may have missed the correct lingo to find information.</p>

<p>I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3180499/how-to-intercept-and-modify-http-responses-on-server-side"">how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side?</a> for the background). I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP.Net which forwards client requests to the back-end HTTP server, translates links and headers from the response to the properly ""proxified"" URL, and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response. </p>

<p>It is working as expected, except for the authentication part: the web server uses NTLM authentication by default, and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application. Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server (Windows server 2008/IIS 7 if that matters). I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck. </p>

<p>I have looked for information about it, and it seems to be related to the ""double-hop problem"", which I do not understand. My question is: is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM? If there is none, are there alternative authentication methods I could use? </p>

<p>Even if you don't have a solution to my problem, just pointing me to relevant information about it to help me get out of the confusion would be great!</p>

The problem i face is that it does not allow @Override for non Activity overwritten methods. For example if i implement onErrorListner of MediaPlayer and i set attribute @Override with it then it gives the following compile time error:</p>

<pre><code>The method onError(MediaPlayer, int, int) of type MyActivity must override a superclass method
</code></pre>

<p>And to fix this problem, i am suggested the following</p>

<p>Tough removing the @Override fixes the issue but why does it complain about it and also removing it may cause stopping some functionality of its parent etc?? </p>

<p>I have downloaded many examples which use this ""@Override"" attribute with non-activity methods which proves that this is used and i might be missing some obvious thing. But i cannot run these examples in Eclipse Indigo without removing these ""@Override"" attributes from all the classes.</p>

<li>I change its name which triggers the KVO Declaration (because I changed the 'name' property) which syncs with iCal. Works fine. </li>
<li>I delete the object I just added and somehow it triggers the KVO declaration (thus triggering the method) and puts me into an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</li>

Could anyone tell me if it is possible to get higher precision results using the gsl ODE solver, perhaps using libquadmath? It looks from the gsl_odeiv2 documentation over at <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/gsl-ref.html#Driver"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/gsl-ref.html#Driver</a> that they only take doubles, but is this really the case?</p>

<p>If not could anyone suggest an alternative? Does something like 'odeint' support higher than double precision? Do I have to write my own from scratch?</p>

"219","How to put text over an image without absolute positioning or setting the image as backbround","<p>I'm trying to see if it is possible to put some text over an image without using position: absolute or having the image being, the background of an element.<br>
The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e-mail, and it turns out that hotmail supports neither.<br>
I remember that when I first began studying CSS, fiddling around with float-ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image. Sadly, I can't reproduce that behavior.</p>

<p>Full story (edited in):<br>
I received a fancy layout from the graphics designer. It's basically a nice background picture, with logos linking to websites and what basically is a ""text goes here"" area in the middle.<br>
As usual in these cases, I'm using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser+crossmailclient.<br>
The problem arises from the fact that the middle ""text goes here"" area is not a white rectangle, but has a some background graphics.<br>
Having made some test, it appears that Live Hotmail does not seem to like neither position: absolute or background-image; relative margins are also not good because they'd ruin the rest of the layout.</p>

<p>Current version, works in any other mail client/website:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src='myimage.jpg' width='600' height='400' alt=''&gt;
&lt;p style=""position: absolute; top: 120px; width: 500px; padding-left: 30px;""&gt;
blablabla&lt;br&gt;
yadda yadda&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

<p>Imagine that I have two tables, Table A and Table B. The table B has the IDtableA field, because is a child, and imagine that I have the following situation:</p>

<p>1.- user A load record 1 from TableA and load it in the context.
2.- user A load all the child records from table B.
3.- user B add a new record to table B that is child of table A.
4.- user A save changes and delete record 1 and all the childs that he loaded in the first time, but not include the new child add by the user B.</p>

<p>So in SqlLite I don't have a model, neither realationships between tables, when user B add a new child, not check if the parent exists.</p>

"237","DataSet defined by ReadXmlSchema: why do column datatypes change after filling?","<p>I have a process that exports the results of a database call to a CSV file. The data types and file format must match a specific format so the file can be uploaded to an external system. This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP.NET (.NET 2.0) webform and suddenly (sometime over the last 6-18 months) it's not working the way it used to. Perhaps after .NET 4.0 was installed on the client server, or maybe after some other framework update(?) or windows update(?) or provider update(?). Our DLL has not changed in a few years. I'd like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible.</p>

<p>There are three data types being exported: integer, string, and decimal. <b>The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now.</b> The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format, so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it. Here is a simplified example of the XSD file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema id=""FDSR"" xmlns="""" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" xmlns:msdata=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata""&gt;
  &lt;xs:element name=""FDSR"" msdata:IsDataSet=""true"" msdata:Locale=""en-CA""&gt;
    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
      &lt;xs:choice maxOccurs=""unbounded""&gt;
        &lt;xs:element name=""TBLEXPORT""&gt;
          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=""INTCOLUMN1"" type=""xs:integer"" minOccurs=""0"" /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=""STRCOLUMN2"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0"" /&gt;
              &lt;xs:element name=""DBLCOLUMN3"" type=""xs:decimal"" minOccurs=""0"" /&gt;
            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;
          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
        &lt;/xs:element&gt;
      &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The data types defined for each column used to persist after the data was loaded, but now they are reset by the data load. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Dim ds as New DataSet
ds.ReadXmlSchema(""MyFile.xsd"")

' Breakpoint here: 
' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType shows: {Name = ""Int64"" FullName = ""System.Int64""}

Dim db as New DatabaseCall(""my db call..."")    
ds = db.ReturnData()

' Breakpoint here: 
' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType now shows: {Name = ""Decimal"" FullName = ""System.Decimal""}

GenerateCSVOutput(ds)
</code></pre>

<p><b>How can I force the <code>integer</code> column to remain an <code>integer</code> after the database call? Or how can I change the datatype after populating the dataset?</b></p>

<p>This code has been simplified for posting, but basically the db.ReturnData() is calling an Oracle stored procedure to do some processing and return the data using <code>System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter.Fill(dataset)</code> to populate the DataSet. There is no <code>integer</code> column in Oracle so the source table has the column defined as <code>NUMBER(1,0)</code>. It's definitely outputting the correct precision, I just don't understand why the column type in the DataSet is suddenly changing when it is explicitly defined as an integer. Unfortunately the CSV file needs to be uploaded to an external government system that will not accept <code>1.0</code> for <code>1</code>...</p>

"252","Custom View Scrolling issues Android","<p>I've been designing an application that requires the use of a scrollbar on a custom view. The problem that I have run into is that my custom view's height will constantly change when new items are added by the user. I suspect that this isn't a very unusual problem, but to complicate things, I'm not actually adding new objects to my custom view, I'm just drawing Bitmap images on the canvas. The reason this is troublesome to me is when Android inflates the layout, it sets the size to be whatever I tell it (0dip) and as I add the Bitmaps, it simply changes the size to fill the Scrollview; thereby, whenever the Custom View draws an image beyond the current height constraints, instead of scrolling, the app simply cuts the picture off to maintain the current height.</p>

<p>However, the text that I'm looking for, such as:
""Getter called outside realm of observable org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable.set.WritableSet@4b7361e2"", is not available until I step through the exception (thus propagating it all the way up the stack) where it outputs the type of the exception, the text (which is the part that I want) and the stack trace.</p>

<p>How can I examine the ""AssertationFailedException"" (or any other exception) in order to get the message with which the exception was constructed?  Of course I'm in the Debug perspective.</p>

"258","mvc .net and jquery how do you remove a character before posting to avoid validation?","<p>I have a property on a model that accepts a string value and stores hex values for colors</p>

<p><strong>eg: EEEEEE, 000000</strong></p>

<p>I integrated a jquery plugin so that the user can use a color picker. I like it since it's very easy to use. The problem is that when you pick a color it fills up the text box with a ""#"" character which then makes it easy to change the color of the textbox (for User friendliness purposes - it's part of the plugin). </p>

<p>Now I want to save the value on post but the problem is the validation on the model will only accept the following characters ""0-9A-F"". Which I also want to maintain (no special characters on the database).</p>

<p>So I figured to avoid the validation I would modify the textbox on click of the button. My questions are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Is that the most efficient way?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. If it is, how would i do it using jquery? or something else?</strong></p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>

    public Child(int notId, bool isSelected, string text)
    {
        NotId = notId;
        IsSelected = isSelected;

    public Child(){}

    // naming: just to make sure I do not mess with some

    public bool IsSelected { get; set; }
    public string Text { get; set; }
}

public class Parent
{
    public List&lt;Child&gt; Children { get; set; } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is my <code>HomeController</code>'s Edit actions:</p>

<pre><code>[HttpGet]
public ActionResult Edit()
{
    var parent = new Parent
                    {

<p>The point is that in <code>Edit</code> (HttpGet) method I create <code>Parent</code> instance with two child <code>Child</code> elements having their <code>IsSelected</code> properties set to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> respectively. After form is submitted in <code>Edit</code> (HttpPost) method I give my <code>Parent</code> object a new children collection of two <code>Child</code> elements with their <code>IsSelected</code> properties set to <code>false</code> and <code>true</code> respectively (that is opposite from HttpGet method) and call <code>View()</code> method to render my model.</p>

<p>But what I get after submit is checkboxes, rendered with <code>Html.EditorFor()</code> and <code>Html.CheckBoxFor()</code> do not changes their state. It looks like <code>Html.EditorFor()</code> and <code>Html.CheckBoxFor()</code> methods take data <em>NOT</em> from my model but from a posted form data.</p>

<p>Could someone please explain me what is going on here and why ASP.NET MVC refuses to render my model? Workarounds? Fixes to my code?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"297","How can I pass a property as a delegate?","<p>This is a theoretical question, I've already got a solution to my problem that took me down a different path, but I think the question is still potentially interesting.</p>

<p>Can I pass object properties as delegates in the same way I can with methods?  For instance:</p>

<p>Let's say I've got a data reader loaded up with data, and each field's value needs to be passed into properties of differing types having been checked for DBNull.  If attempting to get a single field, I might write something like:</p>

<pre><code>if(!rdr[""field1""].Equals(DBNull.Value)) myClass.Property1 = rdr[""field1""];
</code></pre>

<p>But if I've got say 100 fields, that becomes unwieldy very quickly.  There's a couple of ways that a call to do this might look nice:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.Property = GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;(rdr[""field1""]); //Which incidentally is the route I took
</code></pre>

<p>Which might also look nice as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.Property = rdr[""field1""].GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>SetPropertyFromDbValue&lt;string&gt;(myClass.Property1, rdr[""field1""]); //Which is the one that I'm interested in on this theoretical level
</code></pre>

<p>In the second instance, the property would need to be passed as a delegate in order to set it.</p>

<p>So the question is in two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this possible?</li>
<li>What would that look like?</li>
</ol>

<p>[As this is only theoretical, answers in VB or C# are equally acceptable to me]</p>

<p>The Windows service is using the <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> to start the schedule's table polling.</p>

<p>I'm setting the <code>ThreadPool.SetMaxThread</code> to 10 before initialising the timer.</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads(10, 10);

        this._Timer = new System.Timers.Timer();

        this._Timer.Interval = 100;
        this._Timer.Enabled = true;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The delegate method called by the timer keeps the count of the running threads so that it can be used in the OnStop() method to wait for each thread to complete before disposing the service.</p>

<pre><code>    private void PollWrapper(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        numberOfRunningThreads++;

        try
        {
            this.Poll(sender, e);
        }
        catch (Exception exception)
        {
            //some error logging here
        }

            numberOfRunningThreads--;

    {

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Often, the service would not stop when I try to stop it from the Windows service management console. If I debug it and add a breakpoint to the OnStop() method I can see that it is not because the numberOfRunningThreads is stuck on a number greater than 0 (often much greater than 10!). No tasks are running and it stays on that number forever!</p>

<p>Firstly, I don't understand how that number could ever be greater than 10, despite the <code>ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads</code> should limit it to 10?</p>

<p>Secondly, even if I did not set the maximum number of threads, I would expect the finally block of the PollWrapper's to eventually bring the count back to 0. If the counter stays greater than 0, it can be explained only with the finally block not executing, right!? How that is possible?</p>

<p>And lastly, would you suggest a differently way to limit the Poll to a number of possible concurrent running threads to a fixed number (.NET 3.5)?</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>After reading Yahia's comments on reentrancy and SetMaxThread I have modified the PollWrapper so that it should always limit the max number of spawned running threads. I will still to make sure Poll is reentrant.</p>

The first cell doesn't have any text in it until after it is redrawn, either by selecting it or by scrolling it off the screen.

<p>I have a screen where I maintain two different Core Data 'entities', the entities are related via a many-to-many relationship. The first entity and the relationships between the first and second entity are maintained on the first tab of the screen and this seems to be working fine allowing me to delete the first entity instances and add/remove relationships between the first and second entities.</p>

<p>My problems are on the second tab where I maintain the second entity. They entities display fine and I can update their attributes, however, attempts to delete them results in a never-ending save loop.</p>

<p>I believe I have verified the loop by adding an NSLog entry into the willSave method of the second entity's NSManagedObject class.</p>

<p>Say you have a dictionary that stores lists of things, such as things I like:</p>

<pre><code>likes = {
    'colors': ['blue','red','purple'],
    'foods': ['apples', 'oranges']

<pre><code>favorites = {
    'colors':'yellow',
    'desserts':'ice cream'
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then want to iterate over the ""favorites"" object and either append the items in that object to the list with the appropriate key in the ""likes"" dictionary or add a new key to it with the value being a list containing the value in ""favorites"".</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this:</p>

<pre><code>for key in favorites:
    if key in likes:
        likes[key].append(favorites[key])
    else:
        likes[key] = list(favorites[key])

"328","Virtualized Development Environments in Enterprise Networks","<p>We are attempting to implement a development environment using virtualization for a small team of 4 developers within an enterprise organization.  This would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating.   We re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24GB RAM and RAID-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain.  </p>

<p>Now we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment.  The network and IT admins' have raised concerns ranging from ""ESX Server is the enterprise standard"" to ""servers are not allowed on client VLANs"" to ""[fill-in-the-blank] is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise IT organization"".</p>

<p>We could justify production-class hardware and formal IT support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache.  Even then it might take months to formally get IT resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need.</p>

<p>I imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows:  </p>

<ol>
<li>What strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (IT &amp; Network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure?</li>
<li>Have you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership?</li>
<li>If you ended up with a IT-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing?</li>
<li>Has anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected VLAN or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, this is not a Hyper-V vs. ESX holy war (we would be fine with either - but Hyper-V was selected since it is ""free"" with MSDN for these purposes [yes, VMWare has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a ""Microsoft Shop"") - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question.</p>

<p>This is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - I suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation.</p>

<p>Also assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it.
This scenario, with different questions, is also <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/316200/enterprise-network-it-admins-what-is-required-for-developers-to-run-their-own-vm"">posted on SF</a> to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.</p>

<p>The problem occurs only when I use the attribute method=""xml"" in . If I use method=""html"", it works in all browsers. But I need to generate XHTML, not HTML, that's why I use method=""xml"" along with the doctype-system &amp; doctype-public attributes in xsl:output</p>

"347","Why does calling ob_flush() slow down my latency so much?","<p>I am writing an application in PHP, and I decided to do some testing on my own to determine how well PHP handles buffers and buffering. Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> would have a huge effect on my program.</p>

<p>I conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum (in display:none div blocks) 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldn't throw off my data too much.</p>

<p>Besides the PHP timer, I popped open Chrome's developer tools (F12) and recorded the ""time"" and ""latency"" field. If I have my terminology correct, the ""time"" is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and ""latency"" is just the time until the page first received data from the server.</p>

<p>So here's the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00630ms
Chrome Time: 565.6ms
Chrome Latency: 28.3ms
</code></pre>

<p>When I call <code>ob_start()</code> at the very beginning, and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the very end:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00792ms
Chrome Time: 540ms
Chrome Latency: 33ms
</code></pre>

<p>HOWEVER, and here's the mystery - <strong>when I call <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x.</strong></p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.005814ms
Chrome Time: 624.7ms
Chrome Latency: 134.9ms ???
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, the chrome latency should be <strong>cut</strong> by 100x, since I'm flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency.</p>

<p>My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2.2.22 with pretty much default settings. I used Chrome 24.0.1312.52 m. CPU load was moderate but not 100% during the tests, and my ram was nowhere near full.</p>

<p>As you can see i create the animation, and it will move 150(pixels?) downwards.</p>

<p>Now there is some more code to animate the listview back to its original position but i think this is irrelevant to this question. (it's practically the same but then fromYDelta and toYDelta will be reversed.)</p>

<p>When i click on the listview (does not matter where i click) after it has been animated, it wil kick back to its original position.
But i used <code>.setFillAfter(true)</code>, so why is this happening to me? Because i just want the listview to hold its new given position. (the position of the animation)</p>

"366","Ubuntu: How to I add string to terminal window title from command line?","<p>I am working on a Ubuntu VM where i have multiple terminal windows open at the same time. I switch between them many times and it's hard to keep track of which window has which purpose. So what I want to do is to issue some sort of command from the command line that would permanently alter the title of the window. One approach is to modify the following line in <code>.bashrc</code> to, say, add the word <code>FOO</code> to the title:</p>

<pre><code>PS1=""\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@${InstName}:FOO:\w\a\]$PS1""
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would do <code>source .bashrc</code>. The problem is that I only have one <code>.bashrc</code> and many windows. So if I open two windows one after another without changing the line in <code>.bashrc</code>, I'll have <code>FOO</code> in both of them. So I want to issue a command from each window instead. How do I do that? </p>

<p>NOTE: The stuff around <code>FOO</code> in the <code>PS1</code> line above is important too, so what I want is to essentially add a window-specific string to the generic <code>PS1</code> specification above.</p>

"367","Rails 3: Chaining `has_many` relations with conditions on the last table, without excessive queries","<p>I am new to both DBs and Rails (using 3.2), and I suspect this is a basic question that I'm just having trouble finding an answer for.</p>

<p>I'm making an app that tracks articles people submit to journals. So, each user has a number of articles. For each article, they can submit it to a number of journals. The submission object itself keeps track not only of the article being submitted and the journal it's submitted to, but also the date it was submitted, the way it was submitted (email, online system, etc.), the date a response was received (if any), the response (if any) (e.g. accepted, resubmit, decline).</p>

<p>I'm trying to allow a user to view all of their outstanding submissions in one place. So, for each user, I'm trying to query the db to get all <strong>submissions</strong> belonging to <strong>articles</strong> that belong to that user, but only returning the submissions for which response is NULL (meaning there is no response yet, and thus the submission is still outstanding).</p>

<p>So my models are related like this:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :articles
end

class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :submissions
end

class Journal &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :submissions
end

class Submission &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :article
  has_one :journal
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for a given <code>@user</code>, I think I could do something like</p>

<pre><code>@articles_with_subs = @user.articles.joins(:submissions)
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>@out_subs = Array.new
@articles_with_subs.each do |article|
  outs = article.submissions.where(""response NOT NULL"")
  @out_subs.push outs
end
@out_subs.flatten!

"368","PHP code for multiple-keyword with weighted-results SQL search","<p>My question is closely related to this previous post which was quite helpful but I still can't get it working right.  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7802724/php-mysql-query-with-multiple-keyword-for-multiple-fields"">Php MySql Query with Multiple Keyword for Multiple Fields</a></p>

<p>I have &lt; 10,000 rows (might grow to 20k max) of data in a SQL table titled ""table"" with (for example) three fields FIELD1 (varchar) FIELD2 (text) FIELD3 (year4). note: real data includes about 10 to 15 fields and may change.</p>

<p>CURRENTLY CODE FUNCTIONS AS FOLLOWS:</p>

<p>The following code below (which I got by following a few youtube tutotorials) allows me to search all three fields with one keyword (e.g. ""dog""). If I type in two words into my search box (e.g. ""dog sled"") then one of the three fields must contain the exact phrase ""dog sled"" for any results to be returned at all.  So if one field has both ""sled"" and ""dog"" but not in that order the record will not be returned.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php  

// Initialize the search output variable...

// See if the posted search field is set and has a value

if(isset($_POST['searchquery']) &amp;&amp; $_POST['searchquery'] != """"){

// Filter the search query user input

$searchquery = preg_replace('#[^a-z 0-9?]#i', '', $_POST['searchquery']);
$sqlCommand = ""SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE FIELD1 LIKE '%$searchquery%' OR FIELD2 LIKE '%$searchquery%' OR FIELD3 LIKE '%$searchquery%'"";

// connect to localhost database...

// search stuff and print out the results

$query = mysql_query($sqlCommand) or die(mysql_error());
$count = mysql_num_rows($query);
if($count &gt; 1){
$search_output .= ""&lt;hr /&gt;$count results for &lt;strong&gt;$searchquery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";
while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)){
$field1 = $row[""FIELD1""];
$field2 = $row[""FIELD2""];
$field3 = $row[""FIELD3""];
$search_output .= ""$field1, $field2, field3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";
} } 
else {
$search_output = ""&lt;hr /&gt;0 results for &lt;strong&gt;$searchquery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoops try another search..."";
} }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>IDEAL FUNCTIONING:</p>

<p>I would like to be able to type a few words into the search box and have the query look for each search word across all three fields.  Additionally I would like results with more matching words to be ranked (weighted) higher.  (e.g. a search with words ""dog sled 2005"" would give a higher rank to a query that found all three words somewhere across the three fields and give less weight to a query that found only two or one of the words.)
Finally, since my database is growing I would like to truncate the results so only 50 results are displayed for any search.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.  --Tim</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've addressed some early questions I got on this issue below...</p>

<p><strong>1) What are some examples of real-world data that can be found in [field1, field2, field3]? Would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs?</strong></p>

<p>The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents.  Some fields and examples follow:</p>

<p>Year (e.g. 2010)</p>

<p>Season (e.g. fall)</p>

<p>First_name (e.g. William)</p>

<p>Last_Name (e.g. McShane)  note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e.g. O'reilly, can't, Smith-Jenkins.</p>

<p>Title (e.g. The economic decline of blah blah regions)</p>

<p>Description (e.g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on ... )</p>

<p>Classification (e.g. 4AB51-45)</p>

<p>Phone (e.g. 555-121-5444)</p>

<p>Email (e.g. jkr@ppp.com</p>

<p>etc... </p>

<p><strong>2. In the design you're looking for, does keyword order still matter? For instance, if field1 = ""I ate a souffle made from lobster"", and I search for ""lobster souffle"", should it work?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not so concerned with word order or even phrases.  There will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  With one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can't even search by year without getting a flood of results.  The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e.g. a Florida based airline, etc.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long winded response.  So, to answer the original question... If you search for ""lobster Souffle"" is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster).  Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.</p>

<p><strong>And now two design questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. It's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want.</strong></p>

<p>I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  I don't know what normalization is.</p>

<p><strong>4. I see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like ""wasn't"" or ""O'Ryan""), hyphens, and so forth?</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from.  I don't think any search phrases will include words like ""isn't"" but might include authors with appostrophes like O'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.  And there will be middle initials too like ""George P. Scott""</p>

This method clears any properties and populates the CMFCPropertyGrid objects (using a custom Settings object for the property values) and appends them to the grid. </p>

<p>When I open my dialog box the first time all the properties show correctly.  However, if I then close my dialog box and reopen it, the very last property is not drawn on the screen.  All other properties are drawn normally:</p>

It's pretty easy to follow actually, until I started writing tests and things failed in a way I just don't understand.</p>

<p>In my case, the primary key is a uniqueidentifier instead of an int field. The repository returns an IQueryable:</p>

        {
             Name = r.Name
        };
 }
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, Restaurant is a Models.Restaurant of course, and not _context.Restaurants.Restaurant.</p>

<p>Filtering in the service class (or in repository unit tests) against All(), this works just as expected:</p>

<pre><code>var results = Repository.All().Where(r =&gt; r.Name == ""BW&lt;3"").ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine, has one Model.Restaurant. Now, if I try the same things with the pkid:</p>

<pre><code>var results = Repository.All().Where(r =&gt; r.Id == new Guid(""088ec7f4-63e8-4e3a-902f-fc6240df0a4b"")).ToList();

<p>If seen some similiar posts where people say it's because r => r.Id is [Model.Restaurants] is a class level the linq2sql layer isn't aware of. To me, that means the the first version shouldn't work either. Of course, if my pk is an int, it works just fine.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get JPA working without the use of the persistence.xml file in accordance with <a href=""http://www.baeldung.com/2011/12/13/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-3-1-and-jpa/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>. In the article it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, JPA defines a persistence unit through the
  META-INF/persistence.xml file. Starting with Spring 3.1, this XML file
  is no longer necessary – the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
  now supports a ‘packagesToScan’ property where the packages to scan
  for @Entity classes can be specified.</p>
  
  <p>The persistence.xml file was the last piece of XML to be removed –
  now, JPA can be fully set up with no XML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that if one were making use of the persistence.xml file, all Entity classes here should be declared here. However, I'm trying to make use of the <code>packagesToScan</code> property instead. Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database. It doesn't seem to recognise that the <code>User</code> object is an Entity. Since I have little experience with Spring, I was wondering if anyone, firstly can spot a mistake I'm making, but otherwise, knows the best way to debug this. I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory.</p>

<p>My backup option is to switch to using persistence.xml (haven't tried it yet actually) but I'd like to be rid of that if possible (one less XML file to worry about).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory, based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue. What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence.xml file (the old and more common way of doing this) and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality.
So now I have this bit of code in my servlet:</p>

<pre><code>User user = new User();
user.setFirstName(""John"");
user.setLastName(""Doe"");
// user = userService.addUser(user);

EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(""proxiPU"");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
em.getTransaction().begin();
em.persist(user); 
em.getTransaction().commit();
em.close();
emf.close();
</code></pre>

<p>my 404.html displays fine with its images.  However, if I navigate to: <a href=""http://example.com/some_dir/does_not_exist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/some_dir/does_not_exist</a>,</p>

<p>I see 404.html but with broken images, because it's trying to serve <a href=""http://example.com/some_dir/foo.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/some_dir/foo.gif</a> instead of <a href=""http://example.com/foo.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/foo.gif</a></p>

<p>When coding the application, I have a variety datagridviews that populate when the user opens a particular record (most are sub-sets of data).  My problem arises during the save routine.  Because I am using SPs, my usual update line is something like this:</p>

<p>While I could run the update on the row-validated event in the dgv, I'd rather hold all updates until the user selects the ""SAVE"" button.  This could result in a number of row updates in any one DGV.</p>

<p>Should I be looking to add a ""IsUpdated"" column to each DGV, then cycle back through and update each row by itself, or is there an easier way?</p>

"384","How may a linked list be saved/loaded from a file efficiently using Objective-C?","<p>After four weeks of learning Objective-C for the iPhone, my first useful application is almost finished. However, I still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is reopened.</p>

<p>I have no trouble loading variables with basic C types like <em>int</em> and <em>BOOL</em>, but am having difficulty with a linked list made of Objective-C objects.</p>

<p>The linked list consists of memory accessed by three pointers: <em>startPointer</em>, <em>currPointer</em>, and <em>endPointer</em>.
Each element consists of a <em>last</em> pointer, a <em>next</em> pointer, a pointer to a nested linked list (<em>nestedPtr</em>), and some variables.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to do the following in the loading code:</p>

<pre><code>//dataStorageObj will contain the values to be loaded
dataStorageObj = [[DataSaver alloc] init];
NSData *data =[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Archive""]];
NSKeyedUnarchiver *unarchiver = [[NSKeyedUnarchiver alloc] initForReadingWithData:data];
dataStorageObj = [unarchiver decodeObjectForKey:@""KeyForViewA""];
[unarchiver finishDecoding];
//****************************
//Simple variables loaded here
//****************************
//DataSaver is a class with methods to retrieve its instance variables
//The methods are named after the values they retrieve
startPointer = [dataStorageObj startPointer];
currPointer = [dataStorageObj currPointer];
endPointer = [dataStorageObj endPointer];
[unarchiver release];
[data release];
</code></pre>

<p>I placed a debug point at the end and all of the variables had the correct values. Actually accessing the values in the code (doing so in the console worked) resulted in *EXC_BAD_ACCESS* messages.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Next, I changed the linked list loading lines to the following:</p>

<pre><code>startPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj startPointer]];
currPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj currPointer]];
endPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj endPointer]];
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>initPointerFromList</em> method:</p>

<pre><code>-(PointerClass *)initPointerFromList:(PointerClass *)theList
{
    last = theList.last;
    nestedPointer = [[NestedPointerClass alloc] initNestedPointerFromList:theList.nestedPointer];
    //****************************************
    //Other variables loaded from theList here
    //****************************************
    if (theList.next != nil)
    {
     next = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:theList.next];
    }

    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem now was that the pointers were all pointing to individual linked lists, so I wrote methods to retrieve the start and end locations of the linked list referred to by currPointer:</p>

<pre><code>currPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj currPointer]];
endPointer = [currPointer lastElement];
startPointer = [currPointer firstElement];
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>My question is threefold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it necessary to use methods such as <em>initPointerFromList</em> to allocate memory for a loaded linked list?</li>
<li>Is there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between <em>currPointer</em>, <em>endPointer</em>, and <em>startPointer</em> than by searching through the list using the <em>lastElement</em> and <em>firstElement</em> methods?</li>
<li>Is there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code I have presented? Without it, I have no problems; with it, I still get *BAD_ACCESS* messages. I want to know if these messages are tied to the loading code or if to the way I have handled object allocation throughout the rest of my application.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

I want to be able to update multiple columns of multiple rows at a time, but not necessarily to update every column of every row.</p>

<p>Here is an example command I would like to be able to execute:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE person
SET name = CASE id
    WHEN 1 THEN 'Jim'
    WHEN 3 THEN 'Precious'
END,
sex = CASE id
    WHEN 1 THEN 'female'
    WHEN 2 THEN 'male'
END
WHERE id IN (1,2,3)
</code></pre>

<p>However this returns an error, telling me column 'name' cannot be null.  So it seem to me that specifying <code>WHERE id IN (x,y,z)</code> means all selected columns must be updated, even though we're indicating which values to place on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Is there any way around this limitation, like a special notation to indicate ""keep the original value""?  If not, is there some other way to update select, arbitrary columns of multiple rows in one query?</p>

<p>The servers that had static forwards did not have any outside network access.  couldn't ping google.com for instance. mail server couldn't Domain POP the Barracuda spam filter from our ISP etc.  </p>

<p>So after doing some reading I removed the statics for 10.10.39.11, 12 and 13, and replaced those three with what's below..  (Edit: corrected IPs in this statment.)</p>

<p>Now the servers (for instance 172.21.37.14) could ping the outside world again.  Mail started flowing (Domain POP was successful) etc. etc.  But I forgot to check if webmail worked from the outside admittedly.  </p>

<p>But the webservers at  172.21.37.17 and 172.21.37.24 still didn't respond from the outside world.  Although I was able to PPTP VPN in on 10.10.39.10 (interface) which is the outside interface IP address. and it is static mapped to 172.21.37.20.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking there must be something wrong with NAT somewhere? no response from 10.10.39.11 to 10.10.39.14.. </p>

<p>Could anyone look over the config and please let me know what I've done wrong?   Is there something I've missed?  well obviously but.. please help!  Thank you.</p>

"393","CSS3 Transforms: Multiple Origins?","<p>Is it possible to specify an origin at the top left (0%, 0%) for scaling, and a different origin (center) for rotation in CSS3?  I am only working with webkit, if that helps.</p>

<p>I am currently using a transform list (i.e. -webkit-transform: scale(newScale) rotate(newRotate)</p>

<p>but it seems like it isn't possible to change the origin in-between passes.  Is there a better way to look at this?  Presently, if I scale an object and rotate it with an origin at the default center, the position of the element is now off and so when you drag the element, the cursor is still at the top left of the element, whereas it should be at the center. Changing the origin to the center to scale it fixes this, but presents new problems with rotation and flipping.</p>

It came pre-installed with Windows 8 x64 and is taking advantage of UEFI out of the box. The BIOS (APTOS AMI) is in Secure Boot mode with the OS selected as ""Windows 8"".</p>

<p>I removed the stock HDD that came with the machine and put my own SSD into it. I created a Windows 8 Pro x64 installation disc on a 4GB USB flash drive formated as FAT32 since its apparently required for UEFI.</p>

<p>When I boot from the USB Win8 installation disc, I get suck when I reach the ""Custom: Install Windows only"" section. Normally you would see a list of available discs and their partitions, however my entire list is blank.</p>

<p>If I head back to the BIOS and disable Secure Boot and set the OS to ""Other OS"" and attempt again, I am able to see the list of available discs in the system and can install a copy of Windows 8. Unfortunately, doing it in this method results in an installation with a traditional 350 MB partition + OS partition instead of 4 partitions which is normal for a UEFI setup.</p>

"401","Is it possible to have multiple cxf.xml files to configure separate parts of the system?","<p>It seems interesting, that nobody asked this before. I have some ""basic""-questions about the configuration of CXF Clients.</p>

<p>We have a Tomcat running our application. This application needs to communicate with a WebService. The implementation of the client is done with CXF, and this implementation is packaged in a JAR-File. Lets say ""ws-client.jar"". It is possible and desirable, that there are other implementations of clients for other webservices, also using CXF. And each WS-Client should be packaged in its own JAR-File. So at the end I'll have our application WAR, containing all other ws-client*.jar I need.</p>

<pre><code>bigApplication.war:
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client.jar
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client2.jar
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client3.jar
  ...
  WEB-INF/classes/**/*.class
</code></pre>

<p>And now the question: Where can/may I put the <code>cxf.xml</code>? Can I put a configuration file in each ws-*.jar? Can a put in addition another in the war file? Or only one <code>cxf.xml</code> file must exist? Which path in the archive is the best?</p>

<p>By now I just copy a configuration file in <code>tomcat/webapps/bigApplication/WEB-INF/classes/cxf.xml</code> (probably also not the best place for it). The problem is, I need to do that every time I deploy the application. And I want actually only to configure ws-client.jar, and not all CXF-WS-Clients. So I want to configure things as specific as possible, and in the write place.</p>

<p>Any answer is welcome, also Links to the right information, which I didn't find.</p>

<p>[UPDATE]
As it is a somehow long question, here the questions in the post together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can I put a cxf.xml file in a jar-archive?</li>
  <li>Can more than one cxf.xml file exists per application? One in each relevant .jar file?</li>

"405","Did medieval Russia reject islam because of its prohibition against alcohol?","<p>Since a long time, I am aware of a historical anecdote about the attempt to convert Russia to islam. I don't know where I first heard the anecdote, I'm pretty sure it was oral, so I had to dig a bit to find notable claims. The anecdote goes something like this: a muslim emissary arrived at the czar to talk about islam. He talked about the religion, the rites, the position of women, etc. etc., and the czar sounded quite interested. He almost succeeded in convincing the czar, when he mentioned the ban on the consumption of alcohol. Then, the czar pointed out, islam could not be an option in Russia.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism_in_Russia"">Alcoholism in Russia</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince Vladimir the Great rejected Islam as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...which is sourced from <em>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</em>. (I have no idea what that means.)</p>

<p>A semi-quoted reference on the Wikipedia page <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27#Reign_of_Vladimir_and_Christianisation"">Kievan Rus</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. The emissaries visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews and the Muslims, they finally arrived in Constantinople. <strong>They rejected Islam because</strong>, among other things, <strong>it prohibited the consumption of alcohol</strong>, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But, at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there, that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980–1584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</li>
</ul>

<p>The first source calls it a legend, and I'm not sure whether the second source is meant to be historical or also more like a story. Historically, is it likely that the Russian czar did reject islam because of its prohibition on the consumption of alcohol?</p>

"406","ClassCastException with multiple wars deployed in Tomcat","<p>I have two WARs deployed to the same Tomcat 7 instance, and both use CXF + WSS4J. The two apps communicate via SOAP, and WSS4J interceptors handle SAML assertions in the SOAP headers. When testing each war in isolation everything works fine, but when both apps are deployed and one app sends a SOAP message to the other, I receive the following ClassCastException:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.ws.security.WSDocInfo cannot be cast to org.apache.ws.security.WSDocInfo
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this implies a class loader issue, but what in specific I cant figure out. Each app has its own copy of WSS4J in their respective WEB-INF/lib folders, and I don't see any WSS4J library in Tomcat's common libraries.</p>

<p>In production these two apps will most likely never use the same JVM let alone be in the same Tomcat instance, but I will feel more comfortable when I get to the bottom of this issue. It also helps to launch both apps from the same Tomcat instance in development. Does anyone have any ideas what the issue might be?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong>
I deployed each war in separate Tomcat instances that both use the same JVM and the ClassCastException goes away. Must be something I don't understand with Tomcat class loading?</p>

"407","Is binding objects to angular's $rootScope in a service bad?","<p>In angular, I have an object that will be exposed across my application via a service.</p>

<p>Some of the fields on that object are dynamic, and will be updated as normal by bindings in the controllers that use the service. But some of the fields are computed properties, that depend on the other fields, and need to be dynamically updated.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example (which is working on jsbin here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit"">http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit</a>). My service model exposes fields <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> where <code>c</code> is calculated from <code>a + B</code> in <code>calcC()</code>. Note, in my real application the calculations are a lot more complex, but the essence is here.</p>

<p>The only way I can think to get this to work, is to bind my service model to the $rootScope, and then use $rootScope.$watch to watch for any of the controllers changing <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> and when they do, recalculating <code>c</code>. But that seems ugly. <strong>Is there a better way of doing this?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>A second concern is performance. In my full application <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are big lists of objects, which get aggregated down to <code>c</code>. This means that the $rootScope.$watch functions will be doing a lot of deep array checking, which sounds like it will hurt performance.</p>

<p>I have this all working with an evented approach in BackBone, which cuts down the recalculation as much as possible, but angular doesn't seem to play well with an evented approach. <strong>Any thoughts on that would be great too.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here's the example application.</p>

<pre><code>var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);

//A service providing a model available to multiple controllers
myModule.factory('aModel', function($rootScope) {
  var myModel = {
    a: 10,
    b: 10,
    c: null
  };

  //compute c from a and b
  calcC = function() {
    myModel.c = parseInt(myModel.a, 10) * parseInt(myModel.b, 10);
  };

  $rootScope.myModel = myModel;
  $rootScope.$watch('myModel.a', calcC);

"412","Can a rational Bézier curve take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function?","<p>I'm wondering whether a rational Bézier curve could take <strong>exactly</strong> the same shape as a part of the sine function. The best way to check this seems like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a part of the sine function such that there is no symmetry anymore in this part, e.g. from $\sin(0)$ to $\sin({\pi \over 2})$.</li>
<li>In that case, the control points for a quadratic Bézier curve follow from the sine function. Because a Bézier curve is tangent to the control polygon at the first and last points, this results in the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $({\pi \over 2}, 1)$. The second point $(1,1)$ is the intersection of the two tangent lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>When plotting the above:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kLikv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Df06R.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this case I used the weights [1, 1.4, 1]. It is now a very close approximation for this part of the sine function, but it is not exact. </p>

<p>What would be a systematic way to do this? And if it fails for a quadratic rational Bézier curve, could it work for a cubic, quartic, quintic, ... curve?</p>

<p>From the above coefficient table, bgrp1 and bgrp2 seem to make sense: bgrp1 represents the maternal lines with larger litter sizes, lighter offsprings, which results in lower rectal temperature (37.70 degrees C) of the offspring. On the other hand, bgrp2 represents the terminal lines with smaller litter size, heavier offsprings, which results in higher a rectal temperature (37.98 degrees C).
 I am just wondering, if the same could be done for psex1 and psex2, but what is presented in the table of coefficients could be due to what you said earlier. </p>

"444","Change Mail from and display name with a filter action","<p>I'm attempting to override the from display name and email address using wp_mail function. I am using the hook to modify wp_mail_from with my custom function using         add_filter('wp_mail_from','abcisupport_wp_mail_from'). If I hard code the value it'll return the address so it's wired up properly. If I use the argument, it returns the site network defaults. How can I pass in a value to the arguments (here: $email and $name) to my overriding functions?</p>

<pre><code>function abcisupport_wp_mail_from($email) {
  return $email; //returns our default site network email address
  /* return 'michael@site.com'; // returns  michael@site.com as the from address*/

I would first like to ask if $x-a$ should actually equal $\pm (ub)^{1/2}$ (i.e., is it valid to ignore the minus sign, and why?). Applying this substitution,
\begin{align}
I &amp;=\int_0^\infty x \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{(x-a)^2}{b}}\, \mathrm{d}x \\
&amp;=\int_0^\infty x \mathrm{e}^{-u} \frac{b\,\mathrm{d}u}{2(x-a)} \\
&amp;=\int_{\frac{a^2}{b}}^\infty \left((ub)^{1/2} + a\right)\cdot{}\mathrm{e}^{-u} \frac{b\,\mathrm{d}u}{2(ub)^{1/2}} \\
&amp;=\frac{b}{2}\int_{\frac{a^2}{b}}^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-u}\,\mathrm{d}u + ab^{-1/2}\mathrm{e}^{-u} u^{-1/2}\,\mathrm{d}u \\
&amp;=\frac{b}{2}\int_{\frac{a^2}{b}}^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-u}\,\mathrm{d}u + \frac{a\sqrt{b}}{2}\int_{\frac{a^2}{b}}^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-u} u^{-1/2}\,\mathrm{d}u,
\end{align}
I find that I am unable to evaluate the second term because the domain is from a non-zero constant to $+\infty$. Were the domain $[0,+\infty)$, the second integral would simply be a $\Gamma$ function. Seeing that the substitution I have attempted has not worked, could someone please propose an alternate route to evaluating this definite integral? Thank you.</p>

<p>Now it seems that the PHP app might be deployed on the same machine as my app. I like the fact that using HTTP (as opposed to say direct database access), the PHP app needs to know nothing at all about how my app works. But using the public internet seems silly for communication between two apps on the same machine.</p>

Should I perhaps extend <code>SchemaBuilder</code> used in <code>DataMigrationImpl</code>, but then I also need a way to override NHibernate convention based mapping?</p>

<p>In the Memory section, I see a section called Modified (orange) </p>

<p>The official description is: Memory whose contents must be to disk before it can be used for another purpose.</p>

<p>But I am still confused. What kinds of memory is Modified? In which case can we say that this number of memory is Modified? Can anyone give me a specific example?</p>

<p>Is the following guess correct?</p>

<p>When a program want to write something into disk, it actually write the content to an IO buffer, which is in the memory. After OS flush this area of memory into disk, the memory is modified or standby?</p>

"479","Android GridView not updating","<p>I have a GridView arranged in a 3x4 matrix, each item in the GridView is a FrameLayout containing an ImageView and a Textview.  Initially the TextViews are set to display the letter ""X"".  When clicked on, the letter is changed to ""Y"".</p>

<p>It works on all the GridView items except the first one.  If I click on the first one (top left) then nothing happens, no matter how long I wait.  If I then click anywhere else on the Android emulator screen (even outside the GridView itself), at that point the top left GridView item changes to ""Y"".  </p>

<p>I have a gut feeling it is something to do with the fact that ""getView"" in ""ImageAdapter"" is being called several times with ""position=0"" before the GridView is rendered, the sequence is as follows:</p>

<p>0
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
0</p>

<p>Now maybe that's just how Android works, I don't know, but it seems strange.  If anyone can help me out I'd appreciate it so much.</p>

<p>UPDATE: it appears the problem is related to ""MyView=convertView"" in getView(), if I simply remove this and always create a new View (as if convertView is null always) then the problem no longer exists.  Now I don't think this solution will be an issue as I don't use scrolling and the number of Views created should be 12 (i.e. a 3x4 GridView), but if anyone can explain the correct solution to the problem it would help a lot, thanks.</p>

"481","From a ruby developer's perspective (minimalist coder, etc), what is the most efficient way to deal with javascript on rails 3?","<p>I've recently been watching some screencasts in order to get a feel for the javascript programmer perspective and coding process, and have been a little frustrated, especially coming from a ruby background, seeing all of this stuff done by hand, and with such odd naming conventions!</p>

<p>So there is CoffeeScript, which I'm looking at with a fair amount of interest. Then there is RJS, but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I don't want to learn an outdated method. Then there is Go, which I'm not sure has enough support yet and just don't know enough about yet. Then of course all along here most of the time here there's jquery.</p>

<p>But should I even use jquery? Can I get around writing javascript entirely? Would/could the circumvention attempt be fruitful? I'm not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session, so if you're wound up like that please don't post here. I'm actually intrigued by javascript. If only because all of the ""cool"" programmers are talking about functional languages now.</p>

<p>But I don't want to waste my time. And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails/active-record to the javascript in a variety of ways. And I need to know what I'm doing with javascript. In fact that's mainly all I need to do. I need to be able to look at javascript, or coffeescript, or go, or whatever, and see it like I see ruby, which looks like an orchestra if it's written right.</p>

<p>So my questions are these:
a.) It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don't know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud (CORRECTLY) about Javascript? Also rails+javascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3 + Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006's ""Ajax on Rails"". What resources do you know of other than ""lots of time""? 
b.) RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript + Jquery (or alt.)
What are the weaknesses of using the 'higher-level' abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, <strong>what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now??</strong> RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right? Is there an ""RJS"" which is Rails 3 ready?</p>

<p>** And, again, guys, the book issue. Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable rails/javascript developer. Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006!!! That is just astonishing.</p>

"485","Casting to a derived type in a LINQ to Entities query with Table Per Hierarchy inheritance","<p>I have a LINQ to entities model with Table Per Hierarchy inheritance. I have a query over the base type, and I want to do specific type-dependent logic. For example:</p>

// this works fine
var result = base.Select(b =&gt; b is DerivedType1 ? 1 : 2).ToList();

// this doesn't compile to SQL

<p><a href=""http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MethodSwizzling"">MethodSwizzling</a> is modifying the mapping so that calling selector A will actually invoke implementation B.  One use of this is to extend behavior of closed source classes. </p>

<p>Can we formalise the risks so that anyone who is deciding whether to use swizzling can make an informed decision whether it is worth it for what they are trying to do.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Naming Collisions</strong>. If the class later entends its functionality to include the method name that you have added, it will cause a huge manor of problems.  Reduce the risk by sensibly naming swizzled methods.</li>

<p>Note: You can see there is no mathematical difference between creating new version and a branch. It is a semantical difference depending on whether there is already an edge leading from the node or not. </p>

<p><strong>Base node</strong> is defined as a node b, such as <code>C(b) = C(f) intersect C(t)</code>, where f and t are nodes representing two versions to be merged. </p>

<p><strong>Simple Merge equation</strong> <code>Result=To + (From-Base)</code> = means that if we subtract every edge in C(b) from C(f) and add all edges in C(t) we get a resulting C(r) minus (f,r) and (t,r) edges exactly. No edge would appear twice and all edges in C(f) and C(t) would be represented. = <em>3-way merge</em></p>

<p><strong>Complex merge equation</strong> <code>Result = To + Sum(i=1..n) for (Fi-Bi), where Fn = From</code>. Each edge can be in exactly one of the sets To, (Fi-Bi). For n=1 this turns into a simple merge equation. In case there exist no base in simple case, we might find sequence of F,B nodes to fit the complex equation. <em>(1+2n)-way merge</em></p>

<p>I have actually several questions pertaining to this data structure. I am posing the first 3 for ""frame of mind"", as I already know the answers. And I believe question 4 directly leads to answering question 5, which I really try to get answered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Prove there can be no circles in the graph</li>
  <li>Prove that for certain graphs there are such nodes F,T for which base cannot be found as specified in simple equation.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find B in simple case where n = 1.</li>
  <li>Prove that for each RTG and each pair of nodes F and T, there is a set of n pairs of nodes Fi,Bi, where i=1..n to fit the complex merge equation.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find minimum n and Fi,Bi for i=1..n where n > 1.</li>

Now, I know that the traditional approach using one thread per connection is not very scalable. I also don't want to use something fancy like libevent, as this is a hobby project and I prefer not to have lots of dependencies in my codebase.</p>

<p>The approach I'm thinking of is to use a threadpool and let one thread listen to the network to queue up any request coming in. The threads managed by the pool then dequeue the requests, receive the data and respond respectively.</p>

<p>This way, I wouldn't have the overhead of constant thread creation while still being able to serve many request in parallel.</p>

"513","Pass object pointer in drag/drop operation","<p>Is it possible to pass the pointer to an object in a drag and drop operation?</p>

<p>Here is the scenario...</p>

<p>I have an 'NSArray' of custom objects. For arguments sake we'll say this is a list of person objects.</p>

<p>The list is tied to an <code>NSTableView</code> via an <code>NSArrayController</code>. The <code>NSTableView</code> is a drag source and I have an <code>NSView</code> as a drag destination.</p>

<p>When implementing drag and drop I can easily get the name of the currently selected person(s) from the <code>NSArrayController</code> as an <code>NSString</code> in the drag process and pass it to the receiver in the <code>NSView</code>. </p>

<p>However, I would like to be able to pass a pointer to the person object so the receiver has access to the entire object.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be that the drag operation creates a new instance of a person object and does not make a reference to the selected person object despite implementing the required methods in the person model. As a result I get a person object at the destination, it just isn't populated with the data from the object.</p>

<p>I ideally I want the object pointer because the NSView will make use of the object reference in order that any updates to the object itself are reflected in both the <code>NSView</code> and the <code>NSTableView</code> (and everywhere else the object is used).</p>

<p>Is it even possible to use the object reference in a drag and drop operation or do I need to pass some custom reference that is an iVar of the person object and then do a lookup once it arrives at the destination? (This would seem a little archaic to me considering how much object referencing Obj-c has).</p>

<p>I understand that a target could accept a drag operation from outside the application, but specifying the operation as a local operation would account for this would it not?</p>

<p>I've checked the apple docs but still don't seem to be able to find an answer.</p>

I tried using <code>UIDatePicker</code> but it shows only hours and mins as selections. Not seconds. After doing a bit of research online I found that there is no way to get seconds in <code>UIDatePicker</code> and I had to write my own <code>UIPickerView</code> from scratch. </p>

<p>So my question is, is there sample code for such i.e. someone wrote a <code>CustomUIPickerView</code> for hours, min and secs that I can incorporate in my project? <code>UIDatePicker</code> has a nice overlay of Hours &amp; Mins text that stays put while the user rotate the dials. It would be nice if someone added that in their custom picker too. I prefer not to write a custom <code>UIPickerView</code> from scratch if I don't have to. Thank you.</p>

<pre><code>class TermNode {
private:
    std::wstring term;
    double weight;
    ...
public:
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>After some processing and calculating the scores these objects get finally stored in a vector of TermNode pointers such as</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;TermNode *&gt; termlist;
</code></pre>

<p>A resulting list of this vector, containing up to 400 entries, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DEBUG: 'knowledge' term weight=13.5921
DEBUG: 'discovery' term weight=12.3437
DEBUG: 'applications' term weight=11.9476
DEBUG: 'process' term weight=11.4553
DEBUG: 'knowledge discovery' term weight=11.4509
DEBUG: 'information' term weight=10.952
DEBUG: 'techniques' term weight=10.4139
DEBUG: 'web' term weight=10.3733
...
</code></pre>

<p>What I try to do is to cleanup that final list for <em>substrings</em> also contained in phrases inside the terms list. For example, looking at the above list snippet, there is the phrase <strong>'knowledge discovery'</strong> and therefore I would like to remove the single terms <strong>'knowledge'</strong> and <strong>'discovery'</strong>, because they are also in the list and redundant in this context. I want to keep the phrases containing the single terms. I am also thinking about to remove all strings equal or less 3 characters. But that is just a thought for now.</p>

<p>For this cleanup process I would like to code a class using remove_if / find_if (using the new C++ lambdas) and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class.</p>

<p>I am not really sure on how to solve this. The problem is that I first would have to identify what strings to remove, by probably setting a flag as an delete marker. That would mean I would have to pre-process that list. I would have to find the single terms and the phrases that contain one of those single terms. I think that is not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm. Using a suffix tree to identify substrings? </p>

<p>Another loop on the vector and maybe a copy of the same vector could to the clean up. I am looking for something most efficient in a time manner.</p>

<p>I been playing with the idea or direction such as showed in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5869573/stdlist-erase-incompatible-iterator"">std::list erase incompatible iterator</a> using the remove_if / find_if and the idea used in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3487717/erasing-multiple-objects-from-a-stdvector"">Erasing multiple objects from a std::vector?</a>.</p>

<p>So the question is basically is there a smart way to do this and avoid multiple loops and how could I identify the single terms for deletion? Maybe I am really missing something, but probably someone is out there and give me a good hint. </p>

<p>I could'nt use the C++11 lambda syntax, because on my ubuntu servers have currently g++ 4.4.1 installed. Anyways. It does the job for now. 
The way to go is to check the quality of the resulting weighted terms with other search result sets and see how I can improve the quality and find a way to boost the more relevant terms in conjunction with the original query term. It might be not an easy task to do, I wish there would be some ""simple heuristics"".
But that might be another new question when stepped further a little more :-)</p>

<p>Also, what then of private variables? Take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public class myClass
    private shared myString As String

    public sub ChangeString(newString As String)
        myString = newString
    end sub
end class

<p>Would the shared variable now get GCed if there were no instances of the class? And what if I alter ChangeString to be a shared sub?</p>

  i need to use current_user model in order to perform some calculations inside a function. Inside the function i need to do something like current_user.name = 'whatever', thus changing the current value of name.</p>

<p>However, i want that change to be local, only done inside that function. Since Rails uses objects though, it's a problem. So i'm thinking, what is the best thing to do ? </p>

<p>Maybe clone current_user to a new object and use that inside the function ? This seems expensive.
Or maybe creating a hash out of a model ? And if i do that, the actual model will not be changed ?</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that hash works, but there is no type associated with it, so if i do something like :</p>

<pre><code>@attacker = current_user.attributes

<p>then, to use it, i have to specify to_s like (else i get a nil error for some reason):</p>

"557","Does a long internal stylesheet affect SEO?","<p>I'm building a site with a lot of similar css between pages. I've decided that a good approach would be to have the css generated as strings by php functions (with parameters) and outputed as an internal stylesheet in every page that i serve. The benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>this way if i make a change it will reflect throughout the entire site without having to maintain duplicates</li>
<li>i can send only the necessary css for a certain page</li>
<li>it's better than having small css files and sending a lot of css headers at inclusion</li>
<li>the possibility that the content might be displayed before the stylesheet is loaded is gone</li>
<li>i can calculate dimensions by using parameters</li>
<li>i can create a layer that will minify the result received from these functions or serve cached minified css</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't seen this done anywhere else unfortunately so i'm thinking that this might be because of SEO. The generated internal stylesheet will be at around 15kb max (before minifying the stylesheet).</p>

<p>I need your opinion on this approach and your thoughts about the impact a long internal stylesheet will have on SEO.</p>

<p>All of the files have been restored, and /etc/fstab has been edited, on the restored drive, to reflect the changed logical volume name and the new UUID for /boot.</p>

<p>But I only have grub installed on /dev/sda, so /dev/sdb is not bootable.</p>

<p>I'm not looking to do anything fancy. I'm not trying to dual boot, I just want to be able to boot from /dev/sdb, using /dev/sdb1 as /boot, and /dev/mapper/desktop2-root as /. In other words, I want to do to /dev/sdb exactly what running update-grub would do to /dev/sda, when I was booted off of /dev/sda.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>This is working pretty well, except this.server.com and that.server.com are actually the same host.  In this example, instead of having two deploy folders based off the server names defined in my deploy/stage.rb file, it just produces the one /var/www/application/server.com/</p>

<p>The commented out <code>$.ajax()</code> method is what I was trying originally, but quickly discovered <code>$.get()</code> was a better method for what I was trying to do. But regardless of which method I use the code works fine in desktop browsers (FF,IE,Chrome), but does not complete successfully in the Android browser.</p>

<p>When I use <code>$.ajax()</code>, and I test in the Android browser it first hangs for several seconds, and then the error callback fires and I get:</p>

<p>Error submitting results! [object][object]</p>

<p>I should also note that when I enable the java console in the Android browser, it does not indicate any errors with the JS.</p>

<p>So it occurs to me that the script is not able to find/load <code>inc/check_stid.inc.php</code> for some reason. But why only in the Android browser?</p>

<p>Obviously I'm a jQuery newbie, and I appreciate any insight you folks can provide.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I installed FF on my android and the code works fine there as well. Whatever I am encountering is specific to the android browser. Very strange!</p>

"606","Getting Metadata From Audio Server","<p>I am using Matt Gallagher's <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/06/revisiting-old-post-streaming-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Guide</a> on Streaming Audio From a URL.  One thing that he talks about very briefly is in regards to getting metadata of what is currently being streamed.  This talk though is frankly over my head for where I am at right now, and was wondering if someone could break down what he is meaning by this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The easiest source of metadata comes from the HTTP headers. Inside the handleReadFromStream:eventType: method, use CFReadStreamCopyProperty to copy the kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader property from the CFReadStreamRef, then you can use CFHTTPMessageCopyAllHeaderFields to copy the header fields out of the response. For many streaming audio servers, the stream name is one of these fields.</p>

<p>Should I use generic to make them like this?:</p>

<p>Is this reasonable? Mainly this reduces the amount of code in the other types implementing <code>IApplicableSystem</code>.</p>

<p>In brief: is there a way to get a list of matching users's public URLs by providing a name alone? </p>

<p>I have tried examining the Facebook Open Graph API; this appears to require knowing the user ID of the person, or the user ID. </p>

<p>I have tried using Mechanize and Nokogiri to automate the process, logging into Facebook as myself and accessing the search feature (http://facebooks.com/search/results.php?q=Person%20Name), but it's not returning any data when attempted this way. I suspect Facebook is using some kind of joojoo to keep me out that way.</p>

"655","Fundamental Objective-C question...driving me crazy","<p>Its been a long time since I've done any programming.  Used to be 'ok' at reading C &amp; C++...never wrote much.</p>

<p>I have an extremely simple Class that I want to use to manipulate the contents of an Array (using <code>NSMutableArray</code>).  The Array needs to persist as an Object so I can make multiple updates to it during a single run of my program (not worried about storing state data to disk yet) </p>

<p>Here is my problem.  I am not clear on where/when I should Alloc/Init my Array object so that it will be in a usable state each time a button is clicked on my iPhone's View.</p>

<p>I am trying to create a SubClass of <code>ViewController</code> that includes an Array as an instance variable, which can then be referenced in the code that responds to button clicks from the View. I've tried 3 approaches</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I've tried to just reference the array instance variable in a method I've written as part of the same class. No Alloc/Init anywhere in this version of code.  When I call the addObject function it appears to fail because the array object has not been allocated/initialized.</p></li>
<li><p>I've also tried to Alloc/Init an instance of my array object in the <code>viewWillDisplay</code> method.  The Xcode compiler complains that my newly allocated object is never used.</p></li>
<li><p>For kicks, I've done an alloc/init within the scope of the 'button click' method i'm writing...but of course that allocates a new instance each time I click my button.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is what I've got in the <code>.h</code> and <code>.m</code> files for my example (this shows scenario 1)</p>

<p>Would really appreciate it if someone could fill in the GIANT blank I've obviously got in my understanding of how Instance Variable objects are supposed to be used. (I've read a wide variety of Apples docs on Obj-C..etc.  Also googled my brains out trying to find an explanation.</p>

<p>The .h:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

"662","Change the XPath-root of an XmlDocument in .net (C#)?","<p>When selecting from an XmlDocument by e.g. the XPath-method SelectSingleNode we get an XmlNode that consist of the first matching node, lets call it &lt;node1&gt;. If we do further selection on &lt;node1&gt; then one might expect that the XPath-root now is this node, but this is incorrect, the root is still the same as in the original XmlDocument. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>XmlDocument xd = new XmlDocument();
xd.LoadXml(@""&lt;root&gt;
                 &lt;subroot&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test1&lt;/elm&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test2&lt;/elm&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test3&lt;/elm&gt;
                 &lt;/subroot&gt;
             &lt;/root&gt;"");
XmlNode xnSubRoot = xd.SelectSingleNode(""/root/subroot"");

//This is the XPath I want to be able to use, but it returns null.
XmlNode xnElm = xnSubRoot.SelectSingleNode(""/subroot/elm"");

//This works, but the XPath-root is the same as in the original document.
xnElm = xnSubRoot.SelectSingleNode(""/root/subroot/elm"");
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to ""fix"" the root of xnSubRoot so that I can use the XPath I want? The reason for my question is because I have a case where I'm calling a webservice that returns an XmlNode where the OuterXml-property shows a structure of ""/Data/SubElement/..."" and so on, but when running XPath ""/Data"" then null is returned, only ""/SubElement"" works, i.e. the XPath-root seems to be one level lower than the actual document-root.</p>

<p>I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, or that I'm missing something vital. However I really can't seem to find anything, even though I've read <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d271ytdx(VS.80).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d271ytdx(VS.80).aspx</a>.</p>

"668","""Selecting"" or ""Wrapping"" an IQueryable so that it is still queryable","<p>I have a Class / API that uses an <code>IQueryable&lt;FirstClass&gt;</code> data source however I wish to expose an <code>IQueryable&lt;SecondClass&gt;</code>, where <code>SecondClass</code> is a wrapper class for <code>FirstClass</code> that exposes nearly identical properties, however for various reasons needs to inherit from an unrelated base class.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>// My API
void IQueryable&lt;SecondClass&gt; GetCurrentRecords()
{
    return from row in dataSource
           /* Linq query */
           select new SecondClass(row);
}

// User of my API
var results = GetCurrentRecords().Where(row =&gt; row.Owner = ""Mike"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can make the above compile simply by using <code>AsQueryable</code> however I want to expose a ""true"" <code>IQueryable</code> that efficiently queries the database based on the API users query.</p>

<p>I know that this isn't trivial (my wrapper IQueryable implementation needs to understand the relationship between the properties of <code>SecondClass</code> and <code>FirstClass</code>), and that it has nothing to do with the <code>Select</code> function, but it <em>seems</em> like it should be possible.</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I know that instead my API could just expose <code>FirstClass</code> along with a helper method to convert <code>FirstClass</code> to <code>SecondClass</code> for when the API user is ""done"" creating their query, but it feels messy and I don't like the idea of exposing my generated classes in this way.  Also I'd like to know how to do the above anyway just from a purely academic standpoint.</p>

<p>This is a software that I acquired 2 months ago and the whole installation is around 50MB. One of the motivations to try apply my basic knowledge here is because I like to see if what I learned in keygens really work in real-life, my experience that medium softwares are much harder since keygens are very small and easy to find the routines that you want. :)</p>

<p><strong>* Just to keep it very clear, I have a license for this program and my intention is only learn and increase my knowledge. Since I have no commercial intention in break it or create any damage I will not disclosure the application - I hope you understand. *</strong></p>

<p>OK, let's go. The application consist of one main executable (~33MB), 6 DLLs (very small ones and some of them are libeay32.dll, etc) and around 90 .xsd files (XML format). My first step was try to identify the programming language used and if a packer was present, please, see screenshots below:</p>

<p>It really appears to be developed in Delphi, with CFF I confirmed it. Also, there is no section that points for an packer looking at CFF information and EXE Information and RDG also say it's clean. However, RDG found IsDebugPresent and pointed for an protection software as you may see. However, I'm not sure if it's a false-positive. </p>

<p>Is it some kind of protection? How to disable this part of code, put breakpoints, etc?</p>

<p>Looking at ""Text String References"" I'm able to see just partial messages and not the one displayed on my custom ""MessageBox"".</p>

<p>Also, There are many parts that looks like an message that will be completed on the fly, for example ""A chave informata esta"" which means ""They key entered is"" or ""Chave incorrecta n"" which means ""Wrong key at"". </p>

<p>Additionally, I noted that are parts of the application when some texts are not stored as a ""TextString"", instead I see ""char by char"" in sequence at OllyDb creating a few strings (also not very useful to me).</p>

<p>If I define a breakpoint in any of these TextStrings it's what happen - an exception:</p>

<p>Is it a protection? Any idea how to bypass it?</p>

<p>From here the only thing that I'm able to do it pass control to the application and all is over. :(</p>

<p>Also, if I refuse to pass control to the application and I continue with F7/F8 I get something like that:</p>

<p>It ends with an instruction not recognized by OllyDB. Any idea?</p>

<p>I also tried to set breakpoints in Names from User32.dll such as GetDlgItemTextA and GetDlgItemTextW since I believe they are the APIs used to read my entered serial number. The strange thing is that they are exported and not imported as demonstrated below. Is it normal?</p>

<p>Once I created the breakpoint and stated stepping into I got this exception again and I was forced to pass control to application and game over again. :(</p>

<p>I was thinking it could be some basic Anti-debugging protections, so I enabled ""aadp4olly"" and ""Olly Advanced"" with many options but it was unable to solve the issues, so, I'm not so sure anymore about what is issue is.</p>

I'm battling with the architechture and whether to save the actual image files as blobs in the database or in filesystem.</p>

<p>My problem is that, the database connection is required anyways as the users need to be authenticated. Different users have access only to contents of their friends and items uploaded by themselves. Since the connection is required anyways, maybe the images could be retrieved from there aswell?</p>

<p>Images should be stored with no single point of failure. And obviously, the system should be fast.</p>

<p>For database approach:
The database is separate from rest of my application, so my applications main database won't get bloated by all the images. Database would be easy to scale as I just need to add more servers to the cluster. Problem is, that I've heard this might be a slow system from a website with millions, even billions of photos.</p>

<p>For filesystem:
I would be really interested in knowing how could one design a system, where the webservers are load balanced, and none of them is too important for the overall system. All the servers should use a common storage, so they can access the same files in the cluster.</p>

<p>What do you think? Which is the best solution in this case?</p>

<p>I am new enough at Java that I don't get the point of <em>nesting</em> these calls to add 'jobs' to the EDT, and I'm not 100% confident with fiddling with these calls either. I think I understand what the <em>invokeLater</em> call does, and what each step does. Please correct me if this understanding is wrong:</p>

<p><em>invokeLater</em> is used to add some <em>invocation</em> to the list of jobs to be done in the Event Dispatch thread. Java then deals with when/how each invocation is done, ensuring that the EDT and in turn the GUI doesn't lock as it performs jobs 'in the background'.</p>

<p>Nesting these calls says to me that we should queue a set of jobs, one of which is to queue something, which will queue some jobs....one of which is to queue something. But the first inner invocation is only ever queued once the previous job is done. Everything occurs sequentially (this is in line of my understanding of the whole process), but I don't see why you would use nested requests to queue jobs to do so. I would have, if I was writing this from scratch, have simply created functions for each invocation and called them in turn.</p>

<p>I recognise, being only a novice at Java I am probably missing something huge that makes this nesting important. But there is no documentation of this, and no commenting in the code about the nesting.</p>

<p>What am I missing? What, if anything is the point in this code?</p>

"701","Has a Dependent Type always a Type?","<p>I am experimenting with dependent types. Lets assume the following 
short notation:</p>

<pre><code>(px:A.B)      The product type
(A -&gt; B)      The product type when x does not occur in B
</code></pre>

<p>Now according to the generalized type system a triple (s1,s2,s3) regulates
the formation of product types. We have the following formation rule:</p>

<pre><code>G |- A : s1   D, x : A |- B : s2
-------------------------------- p-rule
   G, D |- (px:A.B) : s3
</code></pre>

<p>In the examples I have seen, the sorts are always atomic. Would it be possible
to have a dependent sorts s2?</p>

<p>The question came up, when I tried to model the formation rule as a dependent
type itself. My idea was that (px:A.B) is a shorthand for a lambda expression
where p is some predefined constant:</p>

<pre><code>  px:A.B   = p A (lx:A.B)
</code></pre>

<p>The following p's work:</p>

<p>1)   p of type (py:o.((y -> o) -> o))</p>

<p>it does the same as the triple (o,o,o), and thus says that
if a is a proposition and b is a proposition, then a -> b is
also a proposition (implication). This is how it works:</p>

<pre><code> |- p : (py:o.((y -&gt; o) -&gt; o))  |- a : o       a : o |- a : o
 ---------------------------------------       --------------------
 |- (p a) : ((a -&gt; o) -&gt; o)                    |- (a -&gt; a) : a -&gt; o
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
                       |- (p a (a -&gt; a)) : o
</code></pre>

<p>1)   p of type (py:i.((y -> o) -> o))</p>

<p>it does the same as the triple (i,o,o), and thus says that
if x from some set A and B(x) is a proposition, then (px:A.B(x))
is a proposition (forall quantifier). This is how it works,
assuming q : nat -> o:</p>

<pre><code> |- p : (py:i.((y -&gt; o) -&gt; o))  |- nat : i     x : nat |- (q x) : o
 -----------------------------------------     ---------------------------
 |- (p nat) : ((nat -&gt; o) -&gt; o)                |- (lx:nat.(q x)) : nat -&gt; o
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       |- (p nat (lx:nat.(q x))) : o
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't see how it should work when s2 is dependent. That s2 is
dependent would mean that we have:</p>

<pre><code> D, x : A |- B : s2(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Have some logical systems where s2 is dependent already been studied?
What would be the formation rule?</p>

<p>I guess we cannot go along with p : (py:s1.((y-> s2(x)) -> s3)) 
because x has not the right scope.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Bye</p>

"712","Unwanted evaluation in assignments in Mathematica: why  it happens and how to debug it during  the package-loading?","<p>I am developing a (large) package which does not load properly anymore.
This happened after I changed a single line of code.
When I attempt to load the package (with Needs), the package starts loading and then one of the  setdelayed definitions “comes alive” (ie. Is somehow evaluated), gets trapped in an error trapping routine loaded a few lines before and the package loading aborts.<br>
The error trapping routine with abort is doing its job, except that it should not have been called in the first place, during the package loading phase.
The error message reveals that the wrong argument is in fact a pattern expression which I use on the lhs of a setdelayed definition a few lines later.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>……Some code lines

Changed line of code 

g[x_?NotGoodQ]:=(Message[g::nogood, x];Abort[])

……..some other code lines

g/: cccQ[g[x0_]]:=True
</code></pre>

<p>When I attempt to load the package, I get:</p>

<pre><code>g::nogood: Argument x0_ is not good
</code></pre>

<p>As you see the passed argument is a pattern and it can only come from the code line above.</p>

<p>I tried to find the reason for this behavior, but I have been unsuccessful so far.
So I decided to use the powerful Workbench debugging tools .</p>

<p>I would like to see step by step (or with breakpoints) what happens when I load the package.
I am not yet too familiar with WB, but it seems that ,using Debug as…, the package is first loaded and then eventually debugged with breakpoints, ect.
My problem is that the package does not even load completely! And any breakpoint set before loading the package does not seem to be effective. </p>

<p>So…2 questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>can anybody please explain why these code lines ""come alive"" during package loading? (there are no obvious syntax errors or code fragments left in the package as far as I can see)</li>
<li>can anybody please explain how (if) is possible to examine/debug
package code while being loaded in WB?</li>

<p>In light of Leonid's answer and using his EvenQ example:
We can avoid using <code>Holdpattern</code> simply by definying upvalues for g BEFORE downvalues for g</p>

Clear[g];
g /: cccQ[g[x0_]] := True
g[x_?notGoodQ] := (Message[g::nogood, x]; Abort[])

<p>Now</p>

<pre><code>?g

Global`g

cccQ[g[x0_]]^:=True

<p>When writing a function g, first define upvalues for g, then define downvalues for g, otherwise use <code>Holdpattern</code></p>

<p>It used to work just fine, but replaced only the first occurrence of the OldLinePart on each line of the file specified by FilePath, with the Replacement. That is when I added the repeat loop. The logic is that <code>Pos()</code> returns 0 when no more occurrences are found. Then it should go on to the next line. The truth is however, that the loop keeps going infinitely and I have no idea why. I tried adding a <code>Break</code> statement in the <code>else</code> clause of <code>if FoundAtPos &gt; 0</code>, but no luck...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Obviously it is getting late. I was replacing the OldLinePart with a very long string... that contained the same word. </p>

"728","Should we always eliminate calculated attributes, even when it is a critical and complicated calculation?","<p>The ""third normal form"" of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies. It  seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes (fields) that can be calculated from the other fields. For instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. You don't store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity.</p>

<p>Another situation is an attribute such as height. You want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units: meters, feet, astronomical units. But you don't store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them (meters, of course), and you calculate the transformed values ""on the fly"", when you need it.</p>

<p>You also don't store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. If you don't do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly.</p>

<p>Now suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. For each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the user's choice (e.g. Western or Chinese). Calculating someone's sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. How would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the user's sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the ""3NF"" rule with an iron fist? And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user's sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating?</p>

<p>Now suppose a new application. You are building a system for the Army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. Part of your system is a huge bad-ass pattern recognition machine, developed at ORNL, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. This pattern recognition method looks at each person's height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher-rank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feed-forward neural network. This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. Nevertheless, you can see it as a ""black box"", and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database.</p>

<p>At a specific date in the Army's calendar, the analysis is made, the ANN parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. It's a pretty important thing. You will be deciding people's occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. Everyone will be logging in the Army's network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages.</p>

<p>Now, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. The attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscript's destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. But would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the ""remove calculated attributes"" rule?</p>

<p>This is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, re-calculating this hugely important thing over and over again? Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists? I mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code <em>once</em> some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring data-fetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition ""excitement"" for another time.</p>

<p>Another more palpable situation: You run a web store like Amazon. You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a user's record in your DB. Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs? Wouldn't it be nice to have a control, for example, to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment?... Don't worry too much about computational burden, assume excellent memory and computational resources.</p>

<p>TL;DR -- Do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken, or would you say it is OK to store in the database the results from very important attributes, that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods? Aren't there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation ""on demand"", and just leave recorded there these results, that won't be updated anyway?</p>

90-100%) and batch process them to lower compression level (say 75%) to save hard disk space.</p>

<p>I have loads of reference images with various compression level. If I apply compression to all the images then the ones with already low compression get reprocessed resulting really lower quality images. </p>

<p>Does anyone one know how could I select images based on the quality/compression?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate any help.

"736","Working with date ranges (Classic ASP and SQL)","<p>I have to implement a solution where two date ranges can overlap each other. within the overlapped dates, I have to count how many days overlap each other. Once I know the overlapped days I can calculate a total figure based on the price that's attached per day. </p>

<p><strong>A scenario would be that</strong></p>

<p>A customer is booking a hotel</p>

<p>Customer booking dates - 17/02/2011 to  26/02/2011</p>

<p>Normal price (All year) - 01/01/2011 - 31/12/2011 (price per day :$30.00)</p>

<p>Special Offer 1 dates - 01/01/2011 to 19/02/2011 (price per day :$20.00)</p>

<p>Special Offer 2 dates - 17/02/2011 to 24/02/2011 (price per day :$10.00)</p>

<p>In the above scenario, the proposed algorithm should work out the cheapest offer that the date ranges overlap and work out the price for the booking. If there is no special offer available it uses the normal price.</p>

<p>So for the first two days the system should get the price from ""special offer 1"" as it's the cheapest available price. Next 5 days should be ""Special offer 2 price"" and for the next 2 days it'll be normal price.</p>

<p>I'd be grateful to see both SQL(using MS-SQL Server) or Code base answers to get the diffrenet views.</p>

<p>I hope the question is clear and looking foward to see the answers.</p>

The test file ""test.ext"" used in the example only contains 100x5 '%'s so nothing really should be included in the final image?</p>

            //if visible, then toggle visibility back to gone
            stub.setVisibility(View.GONE);

<p>The problem I am running into is that since I am inflating the stub for that row, every certain (10 in my Gnexus case) rows, there is one with the items highlighted - when it should have only been one. For example, if there are 40 list items, row 1, 10, and 40 will have the stub inflated when the user only tapped item one. </p>

<p>How would I show it only for the row specified, and have it not affect further views when it's reusing the same row?</p>

"754","Migrating a multi-project Subversion repo with a common trunk to Git?","<p>I began using Git last year and have enjoyed it so much that I'm considering switching over my largest, most active Subversion repo.  Unfortunately, that repo contains several (related, but independant) projects.</p>

<p>There are many, many pages describing how to convert a single-project repo, but far fewer for multi-project repos.  In fact, I've only <a href=""http://veys.com/2010/07/24/migrating-multi-project-subversion-repositories-to-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">found</a> a <a href=""http://daneomatic.com/wp/2010/11/01/svn-to-multiple-git-repos/"" rel=""nofollow"">few</a>, and they all seem to assume that each project has its own trunk:</p>

<pre><code>project1/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
project2/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
project3/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
</code></pre>

<p>Regrettably, <em>my</em> Subversion repo looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>branches/
    *empty*
tags/
    project1-0.9/
    project1-1.0/
    project1-1.0.1/
    project2-0.9/
    project2-0.9.1/
    project3-0.5/
trunk/
    project1/
    project2/
    project3/
</code></pre>

<p>Worse, the tags are all created from the working copy (e.g. <code>svn copy . svn://example.com/svn/tags/project1-1.0.2</code>), so include small changes never commited to the trunk (mostly hard-coding version numbers).  Also, there are a handful of commits which span all projects (license updates, etc.).  Thankfully, at least, there are no merges!</p>

<p>Is there a clean way to untangle these projects while keeping my tags?  If it helps, this would be a one-way conversion, with the Subversion repo taken offline afterward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it normal to have php-cgi this large?</li>
<li>Is it possible to estimate php-cgi memory usage based on settings?</li>
<li>Any tips for reducing memory consumption of php-cgi processes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Searching for known memory leaking bugs didn't yield anything relevant. And I'd be surprised if the default Debian packages/config had such an obvious memory leak. Other users on the same host do not have this problem.</p>

<p>What I've done so far is set <code>PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS</code> to a low value so that php-cgi processes are recycled quickly. When I use <code>ab</code> to simulate high load, this works very well. Processes die quickly before they grow higher than 10MB. However, under low-to-medium load, all processes grow steadily (because of load balancing) and most of them consume 28MB+ simultaneously, putting my VPS at risk of swapping. Please note than even without any sort of traffic, the processes grow steadily.</p>

<p>I can reduce the number of php-cgi processes, but this feels like a workaround more than a fix. I'd be surprised if php-cgi normally grew like this.</p>

<p>Also, summing the total RSS numbers for php-cgi processes gives:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -C php-cgi -o rss= | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s/1024}'
195.738
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, <code>free -m</code> gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           360        351          8          0         33        190

Swap:          255          0        255

<ul>
<li>Am I missing something? How come the used memory (without buffers) is lower than the total resident memory of php-cgi processes on the host?</li>
</ul>

"759","WCF REST client with TransferMode=Streamed - logging entire (""raw"") http requests/responses","<p><em>This is on .Net 4, full framework.</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to make a simple winforms app that will make some simple WCF REST calls.  It's using ChannelFactory and the service contract interface.  Of the ~20 methods in the interface, 2 of them involve Stream (an upload and a download method) so the service side (and currently also the client side) using TransferMode=Streamed.</p>

<p>My goal is to include the full HTTP request and response (much like you would see in ethereal/wireshark, or fiddler, or whatever), with headers, in a textbox of the winforms app (just to show what went over the wire)</p>

<p>In trying to use the built-in diagnostics (via SvcConfigEditor) and my own (via implementing IClientMessageInspector and then IEndpointBehavior to add the inspector, then channelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add to add the behavior :), I'm having 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>When doing request.ToString() or reply.ToString() in BeforeSendRequest and AfterReceiveReply, it only gets the 'body' and not the headers.  Digging around in the objects in the debugger it looks like the reply has them in reply.Properties[""httpResponse""], but the request's request.Properties[""httpRequest""] has an empty Headers property even though Fiddler shows headers for Content-Type, Host, Accept-Encoding, and Connection.  It seems like there's likely a better way to get the 'raw' message that I'm missing (and if there's not, someone probably knows an existing chunk of code to 'reconstruct' the raw one from the Message)</li>
<li>Since the transfer mode is Streamed, the 'body' part just shows up as the string '... stream ...', both in SvcTraceViewer (and the 'raw' svclog - even with logEntireMessage=true) and when doing a ToString().  If the mode is Buffered instead, it shows the actual body fine.  I tried making a copy with reply.CreateBufferedCopy(int.MaxValue); but that then caused the actual WCF call to fail with an InvalidOperationException: This message cannot support the operation because it has been copied.</li>
</ol>

<p>One fallback would be to move the client to Buffered and just change to StreamedRequest for the one upload call and StreamedResponse for the download call (but I'd have to do that programmatically AFAICT, as it's set at the binding level in the config and I don't see anyway of doing it via attributes on the calls), which would take care of the 'body' part and leave me with just the ""get the http request headers"" (issue #1, specifically request.Properties[""httpRequest""].Headers being empty) to deal with, but I'm hoping there's some way of logging the 'raw' messages without doing so, leaving the TransferMode as Streamed.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>And that bundle depends on doctrine/data-fixtures with * (https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/data-fixtures)</p>

<p>Now when i run composer update in the project, it tells me that there is nothing to satisfy the doctrine/data-fixtures dependency. Either a typo in the name, or no ""stable"" version available since the minimum-stability defaults to stable.</p>

<p>It does want to install the doctrine-fixtures-bundle in ""dev"" stability, since putting dev-master automatically puts this dependency in ""dev"" stability. But this does nothing for the deps of this dep, they keep wanting to install as stable since that is my minimum-stability.</p>

<p>At this point i can fix this, by adding doctrine/data-fixtures: dev-master or with @dev to my composer.json in the project. </p>

<p>But since this is only one example (knpmenubundle, fosuserbundle, etc etc) i will have to manually go and add all deps of deps that don't install to my own composer file.</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  I’m shopping for a laptop, which would support my 2 main modes of operation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <strong>desk mode</strong>, I do many hours of design work with OrCAD, Altium, SolidWorks, Visio; also write code in Visual Studio and Eclipse.  For that, I’d like to have 2x large external monitors.  If needed, monitors can be connected through dock station.  If it's possible to choose between portrait and landscape orientation of monitors, that would be a bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>field mode</strong>, I still need to run CAD packages, but only to look-up and tweak things occasionally.  Field mode happens in vanilla indoor environments, so ruggedness and ingress protection are not needed.  It would be nice if the laptop had a small footprint, like a 13” laptop perhaps.  At the same time, weight and thickness of the laptop are not a problem for me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I also wonder if this is realistic at all.<br>

  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9438043/php-false-place-in-condition"">php false place in condition</a>  </p>
</blockquote>



<p>I have noticed that a lot of PHP code uses conditional statements like CONST == VARIABLE. I grew up with the syntax always articulated in reverse. Is there a reason for this structure? </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code> // this is the way I see it most typically represented in PHP
 if ( false == $foobar ) { // do this }

 // this is the way I normally do it
 if ( $foobar == false ) { // do this }

"782","java.util.UUID.fromString not checking length","<p>When I looked into the implementation of <code>java.util.UUID.fromString</code>, I found that it doesn't check for the UUID length. Is there any particular reason for this? It only checks the components separated by ""-"".</p>

<pre><code>String[] components = name.split(""-"");
        if (components.length != 5)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid UUID string: ""+name);
</code></pre>

<p>Should it also throw IllegalArgumentException when length is not 36?</p>

<p>Currently, without the length checking, numbers are automatically prepended with 0's if less than the component length or shifted if more. The downside is, if one entered a UUID string with a missing digit, it is accepted as valid and prepended with 0. This is hard to debug.</p>

<p>For example, this ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789ab"" becomes ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-0123456789ab"". Notice the '0' added? And this ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abcd"" becomes ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-23456789abcd"" with the '1' removed.</p>

<p>To push this even further, the string ""1-2-3-4-5"" will also be treated as valid and becomes ""00000001-0002-0003-0004-000000000005"".</p>

"791","Need recommendations for a hardy scanner that has a robust feeder tray","<p>In the early days of our company all our information came in on paper and all of what we sold was on paper. Because of this we literally rent our an old bank vault to house the millions of sheets of paper that, some say, still contain relevant information. That being said, I'm looking into purchasing some hardware capable of scanning all these documents and converting them to pdf. Being new at this level of digitization I would like to ask for recommendations for accomplishing this task. Most of this material exists as separate bound studies/articles/etc. Someone would have to remove the bindings and be able to load many pages at a time and have the scanner feed them all through and convert them to a single pdf (single pdf per study/article/etc). If you have any recommendations I would very much appreciate hearing about them, thanks. </p>

"800","Understanding the binary xls file-format","<p>I'm trying to read the contents of a xls-file without the use of any xls-libraries but having problems doing so.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use information I found <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg615597.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. It has a little step-by-step instruction of how to read the file.
Also using this <a href=""http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat%28xls%29Specification.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">xls-file-specification</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I even do this step correctly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3, Open the Workbook stream and scan for the first instance of a BOF record. This is the beginning of the Globals substream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the file-specification or this page with a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd908813%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">list of the record-numbers</a>, I should be looking for for 2057(0809h) but the whole file doesn't contain that record anywhere(also using a hexa-editor when trying to find it).
But then I read this part on page 20 in the specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Byte Swapping Excel BIFF files are transportable across the
  MS-DOS/Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems, among others. To
  support transportability, Excel writes BIFF files where the low-order
  byte of the word appears first in the file, followed by the highorder
  byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand that correctly (not sure that I do) big endian of the words are used, so that what I'm looking for is actually 2312(0908h). This makes the impression of being correct as it is found very early in every file i try.</p>

<p>So then over to the next step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4, Read the Globals substream, loading the BoundSheet8 records and the SST into memory. For more details, see Globals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look for 133(8500h) and it's found shortly after BOF, good. But the problem lies in the two next steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5, From the BoundSheet8 record that corresponds to the substream you want to open, read the first 4 bytes, which contains the lbPlyPos FilePointer.
  6, Go to the offset in the stream specified by the lbPlyPos FilePointer. This is the BOF record for the worksheet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the following 4 bytes is a pointer that points to a position in the file I should go to. But reading those bytes in any order gives me a number that is larger than the whole file. And also, this part confuses me: ""This is the BOF record for the worksheet."" Wasn't that what I found in an earlier step? Hmm...</p>

<p>Sorry for my rambling. And I hope I make sense and that someone would be willing to help me a little.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Okay, I've gotten a little further with this. It's quite confusing to me but it seems that each record is also read as ""big endian"", ie the last variable in the record is the one that is positioned earliest in the file. Though I don't know if it applies to values with variable length? So, looking at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd773237%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, the values of variable length are listed as the last one in a record. But obviously they can't come as the first in the file because there would be no way to know how many bytes to read in if that info comes after it?
Anyway, if I ignore this value, and and skip 2 bytes for dt and A/unused and read the following 4 bytes as a uint it turns out as 1130 in my case. Adding that to the pos of the first BOF gives me the exact position of the sheet-BOF. And that cant be a coincidence, right?</p>

<p>Now the next problem arises. After that BOF-record the index-record is supposed to follow immediately. But no matter in what way I read in the bytes it still makes no sense...
Here's what it looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>09 08 10 00 00 06 10 00 BB 0D CC 07 00 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 02 0E
  00 00 00 00 00 1E 00 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 3E 02 12 00 B6 06 00 00
  00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 DD
  06 0F 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 02 00 02 00 DD 06 0F 00 00 00 00 00
  7D 00 0C 00 04 00 04 etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first 2 bytes there being the BOF record 09 08, or 0809 swapped which is 2057 (which represents BOF) so the rest should be the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd907627.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">INDEX</a> but doesn't make sense... I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me with this.</p>

"808","Monitoring an ISC DHCP Failover Status Using Nagios","<p>I recently implemented ISC DHCP Failover and it's working beautifully, but I'd like to monitor the current status of the failover using Nagios.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would like my Nagios check to:
 
 <li> report a <strong>WARNING</strong> when the Secondary DHCP server kicks in (starts serving addresses due to an issue with the Primary)</li>
 <li> report a <strong>CRITICAL</strong> when both the Primary and Secondary aren't active.</li></p>

<p>Monitoring the <code>dhcpd</code> process to see if it is running or not is unfortunately not the true solution -- a failover state can activate even when <code>dhcpd</code> is still running.</p>

<p>From what I've researched, it appears <code>dhcpd</code> cannot be queried for a current status.  Aside from parsing log files, does anyone know of a clean way to determine whether a <code>dhcpd</code> server is currently in a failover state or not?</p>

"809","How Can We Create Blackbox Logs for Nginx?","<p>There's an article out there, <a href=""http://onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2004/04/22/blackbox_logs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Profiling LAMP Applications with Apache's Blackbox Logs</a>, that describes how to create a log that records a lot of detailed information missing in the common and combined log formats. This information is supposed to help you resolve performance issues. As the author notes ""While the common log-file format (and the combined format) are great for hit tracking, they aren't suitable for getting hardcore performance data.""</p>

<p>The article describes a ""blackbox"" log format, like a blackbox flight recorder on an aircraft, that gathers information used to profile server performance, missing from the hit tracking log formats: Keep alive status, remote port, child processes, bytes sent, etc.</p>

<p><code>LogFormat ""%a/%S %X %t \""%r\"" %s/%&gt;s %{pid}P/%{tid}P %T/%D %I/%O/%B"" blackbox</code></p>

<p>I'm trying to recreate as much of the format for Nginx, and would like help filling in the blanks. Here's what Nginx blackbox format would look like, the unmapped Apache directives have question marks after their names.</p>

<pre><code>access_log blackbox '$remote_addr/$remote_port X? [$time_local] ""$request""'
                    's?/$status $pid/0 T?/D? I?/$bytes_sent/$body_bytes_sent'
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a table of the variables I've been able to map from the Nginx documentation.</p>

<pre><code>%a = $remote_addr - The IP address of the remote client.
%S = $remote_port - The port of the remote client.
%X = ? - Keep alive status.
%t = $time_local - The start time of the request.
%r = $request - The first line of request containing method verb, path and protocol.
%s = ? - Status before any redirections.
%&gt;s = $status - Status after any redirections.
%{pid}P = $pid - The process id.
%{tid}P = N/A - The thread id, which is non-applicable to Nignx.
%T = ? - The time in seconds to handle the request.
%D = $request_time - The time in milliseconds to handle the request.
%I = ? - The count of bytes received including headers. 
%O = $bytes_sent - The count of bytes sent including headers.
%B = $body_bytes_sent - The count of bytes sent excluding headers, but with a 0 for none instead of '-'.

"814","libspotify: how to find out if a track uri is correct and playable?","<p>The question sounds very simple but I couldn't find a way to check if a track uri is correct.</p>

<p>For example, the normal procedure to play a track by a given valid track uri <strong>spotify:track:5Z7ygHQo02SUrFmcgpwsKW</strong> is:</p>

<p>1) get sp_link* by sp_link_create_from_string(const char *$track_uri)</p>

<p>2) get sp_track* by sp_link_as_track(sp_link*)</p>

<p>3) sp_track_add_ref(sp_track*)</p>

<p>4) if sp_track_error() returns SP_ERROR_OK, or SP_ERROR_IS_LOADING but metadata_updated and SP_ERROR_OK then sp_session_player_load and sp_session_player_play to load and play the track.</p>

<p>5) sp_track_release() and sp_session_player_unload() when it's the end of track.</p>

<p>Now if user made a typo on the spotify track uri and tried to play <strong>spotify:track:5Z7ygHQo02SUrFmcgpwsKQ</strong> (the last character <strong>Q</strong> is a typo, should be <strong>W</strong>). All the possible error checks during the procedure don't return any error: </p>

<p>step 1) sp_link is not NULL</p>

<p>step 2) sp_track* is not NULL</p>

<p>step 3) returns SP_ERROR_OK</p>

<p>step 4) sp_track_error() returns SP_ERROR_IS_LOADING, metadata_updated never gets called, and of course the program hangs.</p>

<p>The checks before the track is loaded can't find out the invalidity of a track uri. The API <strong>sp_track_availability</strong> sounds like a way, but it will always return NOT AVAILABLE if the track is not loaded, but if the track uri is not correct, track will never be loaded.</p>

I have noticed that, in the characterization of the distribution via the parameters $k$ and $θ$, the mean of the distribution is $kθ$, whereas the ""top"" of the distribution, representing the point that is sampled with the highest probability, is found at point $θ( k - 1)$.</p>

And how to fix the upside-down shorthand DP triangle, and also shorten the width of both triangles to better match the text width? Would very much appreciate suggestions.</p>

<p>@Alan Munn: Yes, exactly. I would prefer to have the DP of 'the cat' lined up horizontally with the VP just as you say. In general what I would like to do is to make the left branch from IP to DP shorter but parallel with the other leftwards branches: that is, parallel to VP to V-zero and PP to P-zero leftwards branch and ditto with all the rightwards branches. </p>

<p>I guess my question is: how do you shorten or lengthen each single branch of the c-tree from each mother node to each daughter node?</p>

<p>The code [inner xsep=0pt] etc. works well in reducing the width of the bottom line of the triangle: thank you for that. But the DP triangle 'the cat' is still upside down. Unfortunately I am not allowed to upload a jpg to this site of the c-tree as MikTeX produces it on my computer. It appears that having multiple levels of lines in each node in the style of LFG syntactic theory plays havoc with the binary branches. </p>

<p>...in order to save it as a readable PNG. This isn't an option as I'm trying to pass the image to Wordpress's media_handle_upload() function, which requires an index to $_FILES pointing to a readable image. I also can't decode, save and alter 'tmp_name' accordingly, as it falls foul of security checks.</p>

<p>So, I found this:
<a href=""http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html"">http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html</a>

<p>but for some reason I still don't end up with a readable file when it gets to the PHP.
So the question is: ""Why?"" or ""What am I doing wrong?"" or ""Is this even possible?"" :-)</p>

Moreover, as this action must be frequently repeated, it should not implement boring stuff like chaptas or so.</p>

So I focused on trying to find a Cauchy sequence in $(X,\|\cdot\|_0)$ not converging to an element in this space.

Be warned, I am a novice developer when it comes to this type of stuff and would appreciate any guidance, help or pointers to accomplish the goal.  I'm open to suggestions of any type! :)</p>

<p>So, I have a site <a href=""http://www.animetip.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.animetip.com</a></p>

<p>On this site we have a popular feature called a ""jump menu"" which allows a user to quickly navigate directly to the page which contains the anime series they would like to see an episode in.  Essentially we have every series on the site (over 1000) broken down in an a-z list.  When a user hovers over a letter, the menu will drop down and display all series that begin with that letter.  A user can then go to the series they'd like to view and click on it to go directly to the page. </p>

<p>The issue with this is SEO.  We are being penalized due to the number of links on the page.  What we need to accomplish is the same (or better) functionality while reducing the links loaded in the page.  If we could come up with a way to create the menu and have the link itself not be served until its clicked on I believe that would resolve the issue.</p>

<p>What is the best strategy for doing this?  I am no expert by any means, but I was thinking that putting all the links in mySQL and then calling the link as its clicked would be ok, but a friend cautioned me that it would cause a performance hit. I have also reviewed material which indicates you can do the same thing using an array to store the links and then call them as they are needed using PHP.  I grasp the concept of doing that but could use a stub type example to get me started.</p>

<p>The site is built on Wordpress with a completely custom template / theme.</p>

<p>Someone has commented that the topic wasn't researched.  Unfortunately I've spent lots of time researching it, the problem is that I think I'm using the wrong terminology to describe what I need to find.  If anyone would care to give me the terminology or a good place to conduct further research (even a few keywords!) I will be MORE than happy to go do that.</p>

"860","Entity Framework 4.1 Integration Unit Tests","<p>First, a few caveats:</p>

<p>We are building a small/medium sized system that is anticipated to have a lifespan of 2-5 years (relatively short). The system is being developed with Entity Framework 4.1, Code First, MVC3. We are trying to push our team towards unit testing / TDD. It is something that we have not done, but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction. </p>

<p>With all of that in mind, we have decided to build unit tests with Visual Studio 2010's built-in testing framework. We are NOT using the repository pattern or mocks. This is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests. Each unit test is really more of an integration test - we have a 'test' database that gets initialized each time the tests are run, and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system.</p>

<p>When commenting or answering this question, <em>please do not attack this approach</em>. I am well aware that this is not TDD in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work. We are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>We are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller, then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid()
{   
    OperatingCompany opco = new OperatingCompany();
    opco.Name = ""OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save"";
    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    controller.Create(opco);

    Guid opcoid = opco.Id;

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    opco = (OperatingCompany) ((ViewResult)controller.Edit(opcoid)).Model;
    opco.Name = ""Edit - OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save"";

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    HelperMethods.AddValidationResultsToModelState(opco, controller);
    controller.Edit(opco);

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    ViewResult result = controller.Index();

    Assert.IsTrue(((IEnumerable&lt;OperatingCompany&gt;)result.Model).Contains(opco));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error we are getting is this: </p>

<p><strong>Test method WebObjects.Tests.Controllers.OperatingCompanyControllerTest.Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid threw exception: 
System.InvalidOperationException: An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.</strong></p>

<p>I am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn't being detached from the context of the first controller, and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity, it thinks another context still has ahold of it. The reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the DbContext (please correct me if I am wrong here, but I believe that is what would be happening if we didn't reinstantiate).</p>

<p>We were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to SaveChanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers, but I don't want to do that just to get our unit tests to work, plus I am sure it would be a significant performance hit. </p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers?</p>

"861","Does it still make sense to think about effective code on micro scale in C++?","<p>Early in my programming career I was in love with pointer twiddling, lean code, doing everything with as little layers of abstraction as possible and so on. The code was very C like I would say, close to metal and clever.</p>

<p>Time has passed, I have a lot more experience, and I'm noticing my attitude towards the code has changed.</p>

<p>And with changed, I mean, I don't want to bother about everyday stuff anymore, unless it's super easy to do.</p>

<p>If there is a string concatenation, I will never choose raw pointers deliberately. If I need to concatenate stuff, I might add a quick guess reserve for an STL container, but I don't want to bother with preallocated buffers, C like APIs, caches, avoiding hitting the disk, or trashing. I know realloc might happen from time to time, including all the heap locks, extra copying and so on, but I don't even bother anymore.</p>

<p>Maybe, it is because I have spent some time early in my career where I thought of a clean and beautiful schemes with worker threads that process large amount of trivial data, only to find out later that the whole unoptimized realloc+copy+realloc+copy+realloc+copy+5 layers of wrappers doesn't even register in profiler.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I've seen how compilers sometimes do magic.</p>

<p>However, such trivial things do add up. When all your code base uses higher order constructs, it has chances that there will be some realloc all over the place, or cold disk hits, that can cause a general perception of a slow application.</p>

<p>Sort of like WTL vs MFC. Or how you instantly know that the application is written in Java when you launch it.</p>

<p>But is it really? Is there any comparisons of software that's using only very lean and smart code vs software that uses generic containers all over the place?</p>

"862","Pixel-perfect vertical alignment of image-rendered TeX snippets?","<p>What is the most accurate way to automatically calculate the text baseline in an image that has been rendered from a TeX snippet—so that the rendered image can be given proper vertical alignment in a block of text?</p>

<p><strong>My current approach (which isn’t working in all cases):</strong></p>

<p>Here’s an example of what I’m trying to do.  Note that these are <em>screenshots of a web page</em> (HTML + CSS + Latin Modern fonts for web) and <em>not of a TeX document</em>.  The web page is mostly paragraphs of text, but contains embedded PNG images (rendered TeX snippets) for the formulas involving square roots.  Here’s how I want it to look:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XFuhS.png"" alt=""big good""></p>

<p>But here’s what I’m getting...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kjSt6.png"" alt=""big bad""></p>

<p>The second—the smaller—square root formula is aligned correctly, and it was done automatically.  I’m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a “.” character, and then by measuring the height of the resulting image, after cropping away everything below the “.”, this tells me how much I need to lower the image (using CSS’s <code>vertical-align</code> style) in order to align it with the surrounding text’s baseline.  This works well for formulas that aren’t too tall.</p>

<p>Where it fails is, well, taller formulas, as shown above. In the case of the first—the larger—square root formula, it needs to be lowered less than normal, because it extends higher than normal.  My calculations for this are currently wrong, and I’m wondering how I can fix this.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives?</strong></p>

<p>What are some ways of measuring the baseline (in pixels) of a snippet?  I can’t really use <code>\documentclass{standalone}</code> for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible, which produces different image heights for <code>$x$</code>, <code>$X$</code>, and <code>\sqrt{x}</code>.  I’m thinking I may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone <code>.</code> (or perhaps a bottom-aligned horizontal rule) instead of just a single <code>.</code> character—but that seems a bit kludgey.</p>

<p>Is there a way to coax TeX into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text?  That is, is there some way I can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin?</p>

<p><strong>A second problem</strong></p>

<p>I also noticed that I’m seeing sub-pixel alignment problems.  Below are screenshots scaled up to 400% actual size:  This formula is ¾ pixel too low:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJEjT.png"" alt=""too low""></p>

<p>At first, I thought I was calculating the <code>vertical-align</code> value wrong, so I manually moved it up by one pixel, but then it turns out that it's ¼ pixel too high—which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5KkSK.png"" alt=""too high""></p>

<p>I suspect this is fixable by making sure I round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before I downsample them for embedding in the page.  Just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before, and has any tips.  I’m encouraged by these results so far, but doing this correctly turns out to be a lot more subtle than I expected it would be.  Naïvely, when I first started this, I hadn’t considered tall formulas or even vertical alignment at all.</p>

"863","Java program blocking ports?","<p>There is a program called <a href=""http://www.ecs.csus.edu/pc2/"" rel=""nofollow"">PC^2</a> (a programming contest judging system). You can submit java files to it, and it will compile/run it.</p>

<p>I have a program that creates a socket, when I submit this to PC^2 it runs it fine, but I can't access the url (http://ip:port/) on my web browser. But when I quit PC^2 (my program is still running) it works when I hit refresh on my web browser. This means that PC^2 is somehow blocking the port, but not occupying it (i.e. making it's own ServerSocket that occupies the port) because if it was occupying it, then my program would have thrown an exception and quit.</p>

<p>What are possible ways that a Java program can do this? And since PC^2 is closed source, I can't look there.</p>

"865","How to get WS-Security certificate to be accepted by Java application","<p>So I've been struggling with WS-Security for some time now, slowly making progress. First let me briefly describe my setup. I have Java application running in a tomcat, which offers a webservice endpoint (using Spring). I want incoming messages to be signed. I am testing with SoapUI. So after a long struggle, I got the server as far as checking incoming messages for a signature and I also got SoapUI, to sign outgoing messages. However, the server keeps rejecting the certificate and I'm not sure where I'm doing something wrong, i.e. am I sending the wrong certificate information with my test requests, or have I not correctly maintained the certificate in the truststore.

"882","How to pick base samples deterministically in the particle filter algorithm?","<p>The particle filter algorithm is known for its use in tracking objects in a video sequence: at each iteration, the algorithm generates hypotheses (or samples) about the motion of the object. In order to generate a new hypothesis, the first step of the condensation algorithm involves the selection of a sample: the example, provided in <a href=""http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~misard/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this web page</a>, shows an implementation of the selection step, which uses the binary search in order to pick a base sample; the comment in support of the <code>pick_base_sample()</code> function explains that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The use of this routine makes Condensation O(NlogN) where N is the number of samples. It is probably better to pick base samples
  deterministically, since then the algorithm is O(N) and probably
  marginally more efficient, but this routine is kept here for
  conceptual simplicity and because it maps better to the published
  literature.</em></p>

I am working on a project where I will need a GUI/Canvas (still confused on the difference) that has three frames I guess. Basically it is an elevator project where on either side of the canvas there is a rectangular elevator object, and in the middle are buttons (stacked on top of each other) that are used to represent floors (so if you click on the button, the elevator moves to the same row as the button). I am stuck on how you would design the canvas for this. I have had some ideas regarding gridLayout and broderLayouts, but it is all a jumbled mess right now. </p>

"895","javascript counter - immediately implement comma on page load","<p>I have a javascript counter (that works beautifully) and have now added commas, which works too.  The commas show up, BUT it only shows when the counter increments.  It's actually 4 counters and a total counter. 3 of the counters increment so often that it's not a problem, but I need the commas to show up on page load as there is a background and not just when the counter increments.  I think it has to do with where I call the addCommas(), but can't get it working when I call it differently.  I'll throw in some of the code:</p>

<pre><code>var crate_msInterval = crate_interval * 1000;

crate_count = parseInt((now - start_date)/crate_msInterval) * increment + start_value;

document.getElementById('crate_counter').innerHTML = crate_count;
setInterval(""crate_count += increment; document.getElementById('crate_counter').innerHTML = addCommas(crate_count);"", crate_msInterval);

<p>And then the commas function I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>function addCommas(str){
   var arr,int,dec;
   str += '';

   arr = str.split('.');
   int = arr[0] + '';

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE  ""RECIPE""

    ...
     PRIMARY KEY (""ID"") ENABLE
   )

<p>I also made mapping</p>

<pre><code>static mapping = {
        table 'RECIPE'
        version false        
        id column:'ID', generator:'sequence', params:[sequence:'RECIPE_SEQ']
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now during inserting a domain object it always has an even id value. I found out that the even ids are produced because grails gets an id value from sequence and later during real inserting to the db trigger gets an id value from sequence again and overrides those given by grails.</p>

<p>And what to do with this? The best solution for me would be oracle working like mysql with identity key generation strategy. Can anybody share some opinion with me?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT (solution)</strong>: According to the Randy's answer it's enough to add a condition in the trigger like below:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER  ""BI_RECIPE"" 
  before insert on ""RECIPE""               
  for each row  
begin
    if :NEW.ID IS NULL then

    end if;
end;

<p>In the previous versions 1.x it used phpmailer/google mail to submit form, this is not in use now.</p>

<p>(just by calling it in validation <code>if</code> statement)</p>

<pre><code>header(""Location: process.php""); 
</code></pre>

<p>However, my issue is in my PHP file I call to action, I usually declare variables using <code>$_POST</code> and refer to the form field ID, e.g. below for unique form field ID <code>FName</code></p>

<pre><code>$fname  = $_POST['FName'];
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can envoke a mail function and or some MySQL to insert into database.</p>

<p>However currently this is just resulting in blank informatio so assumably I don't have the right ID for the fields or I need to use a different function.</p>

<p>So Question is how to you submit data gathered from forms created with PHP Form Builder Class newer 2.x version</p>

"902","jQuery AJAX mangling character enoding on the way to the server","<p>I have looked through several question about AJAX and character encoding, but I can only seem to find questions about the response's encoding, but not where the data sent to the server's encoding.</p>

<p>I am sending a form serialized using jQuery to the server. PHP then saves this form's fields to a database. The database uses latin1-swedish-ci. The page with the form uses iso-8859-1.</p>

<p>When I do this by using AJAX to send the data to the server, characters like <code>“</code> get converted to <code>â€œ</code> on the way to the server, and get saved in the database as such. When I skip the AJAX and use a normal html form submit, the characters turn out fine in the database.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the jQuery serialization of the form data and the AJAX submission are what's causing the characters to get mangled, but how can I fix this? I have tried changing the contentType of the AJAX call. I have tried using <code>iconv()</code> to convert the characters server side, which causes errors or incorrect translations. I have tried to use <code>utf8_decode()</code> server side, but this converts it into a question mark. I cannot change the output pages to UTF-8 encoding, because this causes other problems with other content on these pages. Ideally the solution would prevent the characters from being saved in the database wrong in the first place, as would happen with a normal html form submit. Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>

<p>Has anyone else seen this and maybe knows of a way of clearing the cache so that the boost unit test framework will not report a memory leak?</p>

<p>The details for my problem are :-</p>

<pre><code>ICU version 4.6.0
(Built using supplied vs2010 solution in debug and release configuration)
Boost version 1.45
(built with command ""bjam variant=debug,release threading=multi link=shared stage"" since standard distribution does not include icu support in regex)
OS Windows 7
Compiler MSVC 10 (Visual Studio 2010 Premium)
</code></pre>

<p>Though I did try this with a boost 1.42 with icu 4.2.1 which I happened to have built on my system with same results so don't think its a problem which would be solved by changing to boost 1.47 icu 4.8.1 which are the latest versions.</p>

<p>Compiling the following code (Test.cpp) :-</p>

<pre><code>#define BOOST_TEST_MAIN    //Ask boost unit test framework to create a main for us
#define BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK //Ask boost to link to dynamic library rather than purely header support where appropriate
#include &lt;boost/test/auto_unit_test.hpp&gt;

#include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/regex/icu.hpp&gt; //We use icu extensions to regex to support unicode searches on utf-8
#include &lt;unicode/uclean.h&gt;    //We want to be able to clean up ICU cached objects

    u_cleanup(); //Ask the ICU library to clean up any cached memory
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be compiled from a command line by:-</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt;cl test.cpp /I[BOOST HEADERS PATH] /I[ICU HEADERS] /EHsc /MDd -link /LIBPATH:[BOOST LIB PATH] [ICU LIB PATH]icuuc.lib
</code></pre>

<p>With the appropriate paths to headers / libs for your machine</p>

<p>Copy the appropriate boost dlls to the directory containing test.exe if they are not pathed in (boost_regex-vc100-mt-gd-1_45.dll and boost_unit_test_framework-vc100-mt-gd-1_45.dll)</p>

<p>When test.exe from above steps is run I get :-</p>

<pre><code>Running 2 test cases...

<p>I'm guessing that icu is actually the culprit here since there it has its name at the start of the 2nd block.</p>

<p>Just doing the 1st test (ie just creating a standard regex not a u32_regex) has no memory leaks detected.</p>

<p>Adding multiple u32_regex's to the test does not result in more memory being leaked.</p>

<p>I attempted to clean up the icu cache by using the u_cleanup() call as per the <a href=""http://userguide.icu-project.org/design"" rel=""nofollow"">icu documentation</a> see the ICU Initialization and Termination section.</p>

<p>However I am not very familiar with the icu library (actually am only using it because we wanted unicode aware regex support) and can't see how to get the u_cleanup() call to actually clean up the data when ICU is being loaded by the boost regex dll.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate the problem appears to be :-</p>

<p>boost regex in a dll compiled with optional icu support (I'm pretty sure this uses a static link to icu but may be wrong here)</p>

<p>If I link to icuuc.lib in test program so that I can call u_cleanup() this doesn't appear to affect the memory held by the instance of ICU loaded via the boost regex library (well it would be rather odd if it did)</p>

<p>I can't find any calls in regex library which allow me to ask it to cleanup the ICU data which is really where we want to make the call.</p>

<pre><code>/opt/freeware/lib/gcc/powerpc-ibm-aix6.1.0.0/4.2.0/
</code></pre>

<p>There is a <code>libgcc.a</code> in that folder but not <code>libgcc_s.a</code> and the linker seems to want that libgcc_s.a file there</p>

<p>Reason I ask is if I try create a simple ""hello world"" type shared lib on AIX 6.1 it complains and says someting like <code>""cannot find libgcc_s.a""</code>.</p>

<p>I have run a command like:</p>

"912","server-side caching strategy for user filtered results","<p>I have a situation at <a href=""http://www.zipstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.zipstory.com</a> (beta) where I have n-permutations of feeds coming from the same database. For example, someone can get a feed for whatever city they are interested in and as many of these cities all together so its all sorted by most recent or most votes.</p>

<p>How should I cache things for each user without completely maxing out the available memory when there are thousands of users at the same time?</p>

<p>My only guess is don't. I could come up with a client-side caching strategy where I sort out the cities results but this way I could still cache in a one-size fits all strategy by city.</p>

<p>What approaches do you suggest? I'm in unfamiliar ground at this point and could use a good strategy. I noticed this website does not do that but Facebook does. They must be pulling from a pool of cached user-feeds and plucking them in client-side. Not sure, again I'm not smart enough to figure this out just yet.</p>

<p>In other words...</p>

<p>Each city has its own feed. Each user has an n-permutation of city feeds combined.</p>

<p>I would like to see possible solutions to this problem using c# and ASP.NET</p>

<hr>

<p>Adding to this Febuary 28th, 2013. Here's what I did based on your comments so THANKS!...</p>

<ul>
<li>For every user logging in, I cache their preferred city list</li>
<li>The top 10 post results are cached per city and stored in a Linq based object</li>
<li>When a user comes in and has x cities as feeds, I go through their city list loop then check if city postings are in cache, if not, I get from DB then populate the individual posting's html into cache along with other sorting elements.</li>
<li>I recombine the list of cities into one feed for the user and since i have some sorting elements on the linq object, i can resort them in the proper order and give back to the user</li>
</ul>

<p>This does mean there is some CPU work everytime regardless as I have to combine city lists into a single city list but this avoids going to the database every time and everyone benefits in faster page response times. The main drawback is since I'm not doing a single query UNION on cities before, this requires a single query per city if each was not cached but each city is checked if cached or not individually so 10 queries per 10 cities would only happen if the site is a dead zone.</p>

<p>I am wondering if anyone has any successful experience in reporting location data through the Flurry Analytics service for Android.</p>

<p>I am writing a healthcare app that will use location to provide access to local guidelines, and hence my users will feel justified in revealing their location.</p>

<p>I have carefully followed the API instructions here:
<a href=""http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/GettingStarted/Android"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/GettingStarted/Android</a></p>

<p>and have experimented with both fine and coarse location permissions:</p>

<pre><code>android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION""
android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION""
</code></pre>

<p>Despite this, the GeoLocation section of Flurry only reveals country location of use:</p>

<pre><code>United Kingdom          127          100.0% 
Vatican City            0            0.0% 
Ukraine                 0            0.0% 
Switzerland             0            0.0% 
...
etc

<p>Prior to adding the above permissions, the ""Detailed Location"" section was unavailable. After adding either one of the above permissions the ""Detailed Location"" section became available; but <strong>all</strong> city fields show ""0; 0.0%"":</p>

<pre><code>York                    0            0.0% 
Wolverhampton           0            0.0%

Walsall                 0            0.0% 
...
etc

<p>I have tested on the emulator, Samsung Galaxy S and HTC Wildfire handsets and I would be very interested to hear if others have had success in reporting city data, or if this is a limitation of the Flurry Analytics API? </p>

"933","Database Upserts - Good or Bad Practice?","<p>Looking for some insight as to whether an Upsert (insert or if exists, then update) procedure is considered bad practice in database programming. I work in SQL server if that bears any relevance.</p>

<p>At a place I worked some months ago, the the resident DB guru stated in newly written db coding standards (most of which I agreed with), that Upserts should be avoided.</p>

<p>I can't really see a logical reason for this, and consider my self reasonably conscious of good programming practice. I think they are useful for straight forward data management and help to avoid excessive stored procedure numbers.</p>

<p>Looking for some insight / discussion that will help me come to a conclusion on this.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update In response to comments:</strong></p>

<p>The specific context I refer to is the creation or update of a domain entity data representation in the database. Say for example a ""Person"" object exists  as a representation of the ""Person"" table in the database. I simply need a mechanism for creating a new Person, or updating an existing one. Here I have the option of creating an Upsert stored procedure, or two separate stored procedures - one for Update, and one for Insert.</p>

"937","Using AddEncoding x-gzip .gz without actual files","<p>With Apache (2.2 and later) how can I achieve the following. I want to transparently compress using GZip encoding (<em>not</em> plain Deflate) the output when a certain file is queried with its name plus the extension <code>.gz</code>, where the <code>.gz</code> version doesn't physically exist on disk.</p>

<p>So let's say I have a file named <code>/path/foo.bar</code> and <em>no</em> file <code>foo.bar.gz</code> in the folder to which the URI <code>/path</code> maps, how can I get Apache to serve the contents of <code>/path/foo.bar</code> but with <code>AddEncoding x-gzip ...</code> applied to the (non-existing) file?</p>

<p>The rewrite part appears to be easy, but the problem is how to apply the encoding to a non-existent item. The other way around also seems to be simple as long as the client supports the encoding.</p>

<p>Is the only solution really a script that does this on the fly?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm aware of <code>mod_deflate</code> and <code>mod_gzip</code> and it is <em>not</em> what I'm looking for - at least not alone. In particular I need an actual GZIP file and not just a deflated stream.</p>

<p>Now I was thinking of using mod_ext_filter, but couldn't bridge the gap between rewriting the name of the (non-existent) <code>file.gz</code> to <code>file</code> on one side and the <code>LocationMatch</code> on the other. Here's what I have.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*?\.ext)\.gz$ $1 [L]
ExtFilterDefine gzip mode=output cmd=""/bin/gzip""
&lt;LocationMatch ""/my-files/special-path/.*?\.ext\.gz""&gt;
    AddType application/octet-stream .ext.gz
    SetOutputFilter gzip
    Header set Content-Encoding gzip
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the header for <code>Content-Encoding</code> isn't really needed by the clients in this case. They expect to see actual GZIP files, but I want to do this on-the-fly without caching (this is a test scenario).</p>

"941","Custom Control in iPhone Interface Builder","<p>This appears to be a common question, but I haven't seen it answered clearly or succinctly - and as such I'm having trouble making it work. </p>

<p>I have created a Widget.xib file in Interface Builder. It consists of:</p>

<pre><code>View (UIView)
  ImageView (UIImageView)
  Button (UIButton)
  Label (UILabel)
</code></pre>

<p>I have created Widget.h and Widget.m, which implement class Widget, which derives from UIView. In Interface Builder, Widget.xib has its File's Owner set to the Widget class.</p>

<p>Widget.h looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface IconView : UIView {
IBOutlet UIButton *widgetButton;
IBOutlet UILabel *widgetLabel;
IBOutlet UIView *widgetView;
IBOutlet UIImageView *widgetImage;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIButton *widgetButton;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *widgetLabel;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIView *widgetView;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *widgetImage;
</code></pre>

<p>Widget.h includes:</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize widgetButton, widgetLabel, widgetView, widgetImage;
</code></pre>

<p>And its dealloc releases those four objects. In Interface Builder, the button, label, view, and imageview are all connected to the appropriate IBOutlets.</p>

<p>Back in Interface Builder, I've opened another XIB from the project. This is Playfield.xib. It's a more traditional view, backed with PlayfieldViewController.h and .m. It contains:</p>

<pre><code>View (UIView)
  ImageView (with a static graphic) (UIImageView)
  Button (UIButton)
  Widget
  Widget
  Widget
</code></pre>

<p>In Playfield.h, I've created IBOutlets for the button and the three Widgets.</p>

<pre><code>@interface LinkViewController : UIViewController {
IBOutlet UIButton *buttonBack;
IBOutlet Widget *widget0;
IBOutlet Widget *widget1;
IBOutlet Widget *widget2;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget0;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget1;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget2;
- (IBAction)buttonBackClicked:(id)sender;
</code></pre>

<p>These are also synthesized and released in Playfield.h. In Interface Builder, Playfield.xib shows three empty rectangles where the widgets have been placed, which is what I expected. Those are wired up to their corresponding IBOutlets in Playfield.h.</p>

<p>So, at this point I assume everything is ready to go. In Playfield.m's viewDidLoad, I do this:</p>

<p>self.widget0.label.text = @""Feed Me"";</p>

<p>In my mind, that references the widget0 IBOutlet declared in Playfield.h. That connects to the first Widget item in Playfield.xib. That, in turn, has a declared label IBOutlet in Widget.xib and Widget.h. A UILabel has a Text property. So it should change the text on the label within the widget.</p>

<p>But it doesn't. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>(I want to emphasize that I'm not looking to make an Interface Builder plugin. I know those are complicated. Within IB, I'm fine manipulating my Widgets as empty rectangles. I'll also note that I've set the background color for the widget's View, in Widget.xib, to white. When I run the project, I can clearly see the white rectangles atop the playfield graphic, so I know the widgets are ""in"" there. I just can't seem to access them.)</p>

"952","Extend .NET TreeView CheckBox","<p>I have a .NET TreeView control with checkboxes on the leaves. I want to be able to get the value of the node when a checkbox is selected. Basically, this is a tree of email contacts and when the user selects a checkbox I want to pull the node value (email address) and place that in a text box. The second part is no problem, I'll just call a JS function to append the email to the text box. </p>

<p>So, the issue is how to extract the node's value from the checkbox with JS. Unless someone has an alternate method, I was thinking about extending the TreeView to not include a normal checkbox but rather one that can store a value. Note: I have an existing control called CheckBoxValue that will do exactly this. Fundamentally, my question is how can I extend the TreeView to include this? I believe this would be in the CreateChildControls method but would love some help.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Ryan</p>

If I want to achieve better performance from, let's say for example, MySQLdb, I can compile it myself and I will get better performance because it's not compiled on i386, i486 or what ever, just on my CPU. Further I can choose the compile options and so on...
Now, I was wondering if this is true also for non-regular Software, such as compiler. 
Here come the 1st part: </p>

<ul>
<li>Will compiling a compiler like GCC result in better performance ?
and the 2nd part:</li>
<li>Will the code compiled by my own compiled compiler perform better ?</li>

I do not have ISP connection rather i have fixed IP connectivity so that i get a 100Mbps ethernet cable coming for switch with fixed static IP Address which previously i was connecting directly to my laptop and it was working perfectly.  </p>

<p>Now with this new router, i setup everything, configured WAN settings and plugged the cable that i plugged to my laptop. It works but...  </p>

<p>Every time i open a webpage, it takes forever to open or might be some part of page loads and then it just hangs in a waiting state.<br>
Things do not change no matter i use it over wireless or secondary wired port (LAN).  </p>

<p>Is there some specific settings that i should do here to make it work?  </p>

I googled and something tells me about MTU but not sure if i should mingle with it, any suggestions??</p>

<p>Until now, I have been doing checkouts on my other machines and committing directly to the main repository. However, now I am consolidating all my work to my laptop and multiple VMs. I need to be working offline regularly. In particular, I need to create/delete/merge branches all while offline.</p>

<p>I was thinking of continuing to have the master on Host A with a clone of the repository on the laptop with each vms doing checkouts of the clone.</p>

<p>Then, when I go offline, I could do bzr unbind on the clone and bzr bind when I am back online.</p>

<p>This failed as soon as I tried to bzr clone since bzr clone only clones a branch(!!!!)</p>

<p>I need some serious help. If Hg would handle this better please let me know (I need Windows support.) However, at this moment I cannot switch from Bazaar as it is too close to some important deadlines.</p>

(and other various questions)","<p>I am not a DBA and so dont really know anything about SQL 2005 security settings, etc. I am attempting to set up an empty copy of our database by generating the full database from SQL Management Studio generated scripts. Unfortunately I don't know what many of the options do and the MSFT documentation of this processes isn't great.</p>

<p>There is an option to generate script for Schemas, Tables, Views and Users. It is the users I am confused about, because I don't understand how they affect the usage of the database. We have some developers in the team who are in this list and some who are not, yet everyone can do anything on the database, at least when they are hosting it on their own machines.</p>

<p>Do I need to keep these Users in my new generated database and what do they do?</p>

<p>We also have a dbo User who is a db_owner and owns many of our schemas. What is this dbo User? What is the significance of a user Owning Schemas? We use Schemas as ""namespaces"" to group logically related tables in our database but I take it there is more to them than that?</p>

<p>There is also a username tied to this dbo User, its the windows NT login of one of our developers, but he doesn't have his own User object in the list...is there any significance to this? Is this a bad thing?</p>

<p>Other Users are guest, INFORMATION_SCHEMA and sys, but I think these are all defaults?</p>

<p>Sorry but I am a SQL admin ignoramus and usually left these things to the DBA in my previous job!</p>

<pre><code>class SomeKey { 
    friend class Foo;
    SomeKey() {} 
    // possibly make it non-copyable too

class Bar {
public:

<p>Here only a <code>friend</code> of the key class has access to <code>protectedMethod()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
    void do_stuff(Bar&amp; b) { 
        b.protectedMethod(SomeKey()); // fine, Foo is friend of SomeKey

<p>It allows more fine-granular access-control than making <code>Foo</code> a <code>friend</code> of <code>Bar</code> and avoids more complicated proxying patterns.</p>

<p>The main aim was to solve 'n' variables, given the coefficients of a system of 'n' Linear Equations. Once 'n' exceeds 4, this matter gets messy on paper. There is one 'Determinant' way of solving such equations. Although once 'n' exceeds 3, it gets messy on paper too, but its doable if i can just find how the computer can solve it instead.

<p>Now, when I start <code>run.py</code> for the first time, it never will get the data from the serial port. They always will be <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>When I run</p>

<p><code>ino serial</code> (which  starts <code>picocom</code>) </p>

<p>and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the Arduino sends all its data in the stream. If I exit picocom via <kbd>Q</kbd> and then start <code>run.py</code>, the python script can read all the data from the serial port.</p>

2. the last element of this array is the total amount of this tax method</p>

<p>the last one seems to have problem. When I press calculate button on my Swing GUI (after running the program), progressive[5] always result as Zero value. However, the next click of the calculate button it return the calculated value and the value are correct.</p>

<p>The following is the rule code that I implement and it always see progressive[5] is always zero when first click the button</p>

<p>In this blog he briefly talks about creating a generic repository and why it's suggested to do so (to be clear of friction).  The blog itself doesn't go into great detail on how to inject the GenericRepository into your project for that you'll need to download his source code of Common Code.  However, once I finally understood the importance of the Repository pattern, and how it makes a difference in the data models I create in ASP.Net MVC I was wondering if I could do something similar to my Controllers and Views?</p>

<p>Can I create a ControllerRepository or ControllerFactory(as I've Bing'd it) and create a generic controller with 5 ActionResults and depending on what I inject into my GenericRepository datamodel (i.e. I have DellXPSComputers, GateWayComputers, HPComputers as a single db datamodel) </p>

<p>And actually have only one controller besides the Generic one I create that will go and grab the right datamodel, and view? </p>

"1026","Trying to understand the Jacobian, part I.","<p>So I am trying to understand the Jacobian, as it relates to the transformation of random variables. The nuts and bolts are buried in calculus however. </p>

<p>Now, I have been reading this <a href=""http://www.stat.wisc.edu/courses/st309-larget/jacobian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a> here, and I have some 'nested' questions so please bear with me. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1)</strong> (Page 1): It says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If h is differentiable, the approximation $h(x + dx) \approx h(x) + h'(x)dx$"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this the case? I have 'accepted' it but I would like to know why its true, although it does not affect question (2) directly for me.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> (Page 2): (This is my main question): Towards the bottom, the author uses a, b, c and d as placeholders for partial derivatives. I am clear as to everything as to how he got there, up until where he puts the a,b,c and d into that mini table with the arrows. I am convinced that in the table, he has mixed up b with c. For example, he has written that:</p>

<p>$$ 
(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \rightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + b)
$$</p>

<p>I am conivinced that the 'b' should actually be a 'c', going by his own definition. So what I think it should read instead is:</p>

<p>$$ 
(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \rightarrow (y_1 + a, y_2 + c)
$$</p>

<p>My reasoning is as follows. For the first part, ($y_1 + a$), we can get it as so:</p>

<p>$$ h_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \approx h_1(x_1,x_2) + \frac{\delta h_1(x_1,x_2)}{\delta x_1} dx_1 + 0
$$</p>

<p>This yields, by his own definition:</p>

<p>$$
h_1(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \approx y_1 + a
$$</p>

<p>So far so good. So similarly, for the second coordinate of the transformed point, I reason as such:</p>

<p>$$
h_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \approx h_2(x_1,x_2) + \frac{\delta h_2(x_1,x_2)}{\delta x_1} dx_1 + 0
$$</p>

<p>So this then, by his own definitions, must be:</p>

<p>$$
h_2(x_1 + dx_1, x_2) \approx y_2 + c
$$</p>

<p>So why is it written as 'b' instead? b is as partial derivative of $h_1$ w.r.t $x_2$, whence in fact we are in actuality deriving $h_2$ w.r.t $x_1$. $x_1$ is the only thing that is varying, and the second coordinate of this point is a function of $h_2$. So what gives? Is this a typo in the paper or have I missed something completely?</p>

<p>Some context: I currently understand the random variable $y_1$ to be created as a linear combination of the r.v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_1$. Similarly, r.v $y_2$ is created as a linear combo of r.v's $x_1$ and $x_2$, through transformation $h_2$. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>That property is on a class called ApplicationExecution. When I pull that object down, its Application property is populated on the server side, but it is null when I try to access it on the client side, after it is retrieved via a WCF service call.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure all of the correct attributes are still there. Am I missing anything? If not, what might have caused this to stop working?</p>

<p>I would like to stress that the problem is not due to the debounce. <code>window.onresize = t; function t (e) { alert(""wtf?"");}</code> won't work either.</p>

<p>After a few hours of trial and error and research on the net, it seems that the issue is that it cannot connect due to bad authorization however I am able to connect using Java code (Using same lib MQQueueConnectionFactory) and I am also able to connect using QueueZee with the exact same libraries, get a list of all queues and browse them so I know user authorization issues should not be the problem.</p>

<p>I am running Hermes JMS 1.14 and I tried using both Java 1.6.0_33 and 1.7.0_5. Websphere MQ is running on version 7.1.0.0 and the libraries were gotten from this installation on a remote server.</p>

<p>I tried setting the channel variable to SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN which is what I used in QueueZee to get it to work but still the same issue.</p>

<p>But the second time the method is executed, I don't see this query being executed.  Looks like hibernate stores this value somewhere in the session.  </p>

<p>Now if the table is updated by a different process (lets say a stored procedure or SQL), all the subsequent calls to the above method fail with a ORA-00001: unique constraint (SCHEMANAME.PRIMARY_KEY_CONSTRAINT) violated exception.  If the JVM is restarted, Hibernate executes the max (Primary Key) generation query again, and everything works.  </p>

I have 4 dynamically dependent select menus. The menus correspond to state, county, area, neighborhood. The dynamic dependence is achieved through a jquery script.What i want to accomplish is to make the menus remember the last option selected by a user for each menu. So i thought that if i can grab the url parameters that would do the trick.
So i modified the script in this way....</p>

<pre><code>getCounty: function (results) {
    if(!results) return;
    var allCounties = $(""&lt;option value=\""All\""&gt;All Counties &lt;/option&gt;"");

        counties.val(w).attr('selected', true);
    } else {
        counties.val(""All"").attr('selected', true);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Is the <code>$.query.get</code> function correct? Is there anything else wrong with my code? I have to admit i am not a jquery expert...The code works just fine if i type</p>

<pre><code>counties.val(3).attr('selected',true)
</code></pre>

<p>The third option of the select menu gets selected.
Any suggestion will be highly appreciated!! </p>

"1046","What is the correct way to stop a thread waiting for network activity?","<p>This question has no doubt been asked in various forms in the past, but not so much for a specific scenario.</p>

<p>What is the most correct way to stop a Thread that is blocking while waiting to receive a network message over UDP.</p>

<p>For example, say I have the following Thread:</p>

<pre><code>public class ClientDiscoveryEngine extends Thread {

    private final int PORT;

    public ClientDiscoveryEngine(final int portNumber) {
        PORT = portNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            socket = new DatagramSocket(RECEIVE_PORT);

            while (true) {
                final byte[] data = new byte[256];
                final DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length);

                socket.receive(packet);
            }
        } catch (SocketException e) {
            // do stuff 1
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // do stuff 2
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, would the more correct way be using the <code>interrupt()</code> method? For example adding the following method:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void interrupt() {
    super.interrupt();
    // flip some state?
}
</code></pre>

<p>My only concern is, is <code>socket.receive()</code> not a non-interruptable blocking method? The one way that I have thought of would be to implement the interrupt method as above, in that method call <code>socket.close()</code> and then cater for it in the <code>run</code> method in the catch for the <code>SocketException</code>. Or maybe instead of <code>while(true)</code> use some state that gets flipped in the interrupt method. Is this the best way? Or is there a more elegant way?</p>

<pre><code>public class MyScanResult extends ScanResult {

"1048","PHP - Detecting remote host disconnection","<p>According to <a href=""http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.socket-read.php"">the documentation</a>, <code>socket_read()</code> is supposed to return <code>FALSE</code> when the remote host has closed the connection, and an empty string <code>''</code> when there is no more data to read.  However, during my testing, it never returns <code>FALSE</code>, even when I close the remote host connection.  Here is the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>$data = '';

do {
    $read = socket_read($socket, 1024);

    if ($read === FALSE) {
        throw new SocketDisconnectException();
    }

    $data .= $read;
} while ($read !== '');
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>SocketDisconnectException</code> never gets thrown, even when I disconnect the remote host connection.  I've double and triple checked that I'm not catching the exception and discarding it, and even thrown in an <code>echo</code> and <code>exit</code> into the conditional as a sanity check.</p>

alias is (null)

Please feel free to direct me to the duplicate that I'm sure exists but I can't find. Apparently I'm not so great with keywords.</p>

The files have to have an 8000 Hz frequency, but the ones I have are 44100 Hz. The files are MP3s, but I've already created code to convert them to WAVs, since I know that Android doesn't handle MP3s natively.</p>

<p>This has to be done on the device at execution time,so can anyone offer any suggestions?</p>

"1075","Flash right click acting differently than left click","<p>I've just updated to flash player 11.2 which allows for listening to MouseEvent.RIGHT_MOUSE_UP and MouseEvent.RIGHT_MOUSE_DOWN.</p>

<p>I am having a problem where these events don't act the same as their MOUSE_UP / MOUSE_DOWN counterparts.  Specifically, the MOUSE_UP event is launched no matter where the mouse is.  This allows for dragging outside the flash window and still having a complete down -> up event loop whenever a user clicks in the flash player.</p>

<p>However, this does not seem to be the case for RIGHT_MOUSE_UP / DOWN.  When I right click inside the player and release outside of the player, I don't get a RIGHT_MOUSE_UP event meaning it is possible to receive multiple RIGHT_MOUSE_DOWN events without receiving an UP event.</p>

<p>Is there a known workaround to this or is there an option I must set?</p>

<p><strong>Edit :</strong></p>

<p>Here is a code example :</p>

<pre><code>stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,         onMouseUp);
stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,       onMouseDown);
stage.addeventListener(MouseEvent.RIGHT_MOUSE_UP,   onRightMouseUp);
stage.addeventListener(MouseEvent.RIGHT_MOUSE_DOWN, onRightMouseDown);

//...
//all callback function follow a similar format as :

{

<p>Given a 2-dimensional array of characters and a dictionary in which a word can be searched in <code>O(1)</code> time. Need to print all the words from array which are present in dictionary. Word can be formed in any direction but has to end at any edge of array.(Need not worry much about the dictionary)</p>

<p>Note: Here ""egg"" is not a dictionary word because its not ending at the edge of array.</p>

<p>I've seen similar questions before, but was never able to think of a good algorithm to solve these kind of problems. Any help on how to approach these kind of problems (forming words from arrays of characters) will be highly helpful.</p>

<p>(The only way I could think of is to find all possible permutations of characters in the 2D array, and check if it ends on the edge of the array, and check if the permutation is a valid word from the dictionary in O(1) time)</p>

<p>I'm creating a front-end management template that allows multiple authors to edit any particular post, hence the need to restrict what is shown on a post-by-post basis rather than those uploaded by a particular user.</p>

<p>The upload modal is based off of <a href=""http://mikejolley.com/2012/12/using-the-new-wordpress-3-5-media-uploader-in-plugins/"" rel=""nofollow"">Mike Jolley's upload modal tutorial</a>. It's been modified to look for the post id in the body class and attach uploaded media to that $pid.</p>

jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

  var file_frame;
  var wp_media_post_id = wp.media.model.settings.post.id; // Store the old id

  var classes = $('body').attr('class'); // get all classes from &lt;body&gt; element
  var set_to_post_id = classes.match(/postid-(\d+)/)[1]; // pid to attach media to

  jQuery(document).on('click', '.upload_image_button', function(){

    event.preventDefault();

      file_frame.open();
      return;
    } else {
      // Set the wp.media post id so the uploader grabs the ID we want when initialised
      wp.media.model.settings.post.id = set_to_post_id;

        text: jQuery( this ).data( 'uploader_button_text' ),
      },
      multiple: false  // Set to true to allow multiple files to be selected
    });

    // When an image is selected, run a callback.
    file_frame.on( 'select', function() {
      // We set multiple to false so only get one image from the uploader
      attachment = file_frame.state().get('selection').first().toJSON();

<p>This is pretty much the skeleton code from jquery.  However, what I'm having trouble with is figuring out the best way to create a ""utility"" function that is just for my plugin methods, or how to call one plugin method from another.</p>

<p>For example, in my plugin, I have 3 methods, <code>init</code>, <code>some_fn</code>, and <code>another_fn</code>.  When I call <code>$('#el').SomePlugin('another_fn')</code>, within <code>another_fn</code>, I'd like to call <code>some_fn</code>.  How can I do this?  Calling <code>methods.some_fn()</code> will probably work, however, then this is dependent on the order the methods are defined within the methods object, correct?  So I could call <code>some_fn</code> from <code>another_fn</code>, but not vice versa?</p>

<p>Additionally, what's the correct way to create a utility function that all the methods in my plugin can use, so that I am not cluttering the global namespace?  Do I just define the utility functions at the beginning of my plugin, right before the call to var methods?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks to Matt Ball, I have confirmed that methods.some_fn() DOES work for calling other main methods.  Now I just want to know what the best practice for creating a (private) utility function is</p>

<p>From testing, we know that if we remove all the indexes, including the primary key index, adding a new sequential id column was like 10x faster. I still haven't figure out why dropping the indexes would help adding a identity column.</p>

<p>Here is the SQL that add identity column:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE MyTable ADD MyTableSeqId BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1)

"1111","jQuery Dropdown for Table row","<p>I'm struggling a little with my current project, and hope someone can help clarify things for me.  </p>

<p>I have a table where I need to perform actions based on a given row, with a jQueryUI button in the first td, which should drop down a menu with functions for the row.  Each tr has values to identify both the person and item, but I don't know how to dynamically create the dropdown to handle the specific items of the row.</p>

<p>For example, my tr looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr person=""1"" item=""1""&gt;&lt;td class=""ddmenu""&gt;Row1&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr person=""2"" item=""5""&gt;&lt;td class=""ddmenu""&gt;Row2&lt;/td&gt;...&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My jQuery functions, which locate the person and item ids for the row, and drops down the menu:</p>

<pre><code>$('.ddmenu')
.click(function() { 
var person = $(this).parents(""tr"").attr('person');
var item = $(this).parents(""tr"").attr('item');
$('.drop').toggle();
return false;
}) 
</code></pre>

<p>I have an intial  item that lists the same items for each row, but have the following two problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I create the dynamic dropdown menu with the person and item values, so I can act upon each item with separate jQuery selectors.</li>
<li>How can I drop the menu directly below the specific button, rather than the location of the div in the html?</li>
</ol>

"1116","Generics and reflection","<p>Have a very interesting situation and can't seem to find anything concrete on the webs surrounding reflection, inheritance and generics.</p>

<p>To start off with:</p>

<p>I have a base abstract classed, called:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class ItemBase
{
     // default properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>ItemBase then becomes my super-class to an abstract entity called Item:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Item
{
    // some extra properties
}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea behind this is to construct entities that will inherit from Item with additional properties set:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class City : Item {}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in a test method I'm trying to use reflection to invoke a method on the passed entity and return whatever data, in what ever form, back from the method.</p>

<p>Assuming, for testing purposes we have a method in State, that returns a collection of all major cities:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;City&gt; GetAllMajorCities() {}
</code></pre>

<p>In my stubs I might have a test to get all cities:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Item&gt; cities = this.InvokeGenericMethod&lt;Item&gt;(""State"", ""GetAllMajorCities"", args);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the InvokeGenericMethod(string, string, object[] args) looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; InvokeGenericMethod&lt;Item&gt;(string className, string methodName, object[] args)
{
     Type classType = className.GetType(); // to get the class to create an instance of
     object classObj = Activator.CreateInstance(classType);
     object ret = classType.InvokeMember(methodName, BindingFlags.InvokeMethod, null, classObj, args);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In theory, from the example given, the value of ""ret"" should be a type of IEnumerable, however, the returning type, if added to a watch to investivage, return List, if I check the ret value as:</p>

<pre><code>if (ret is IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)
</code></pre>

<p>it ignores the check.</p>

<p>If I change </p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;City&gt; GetAllMajorCities() {}
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;ItemBase&gt; GetAllMajorCities() {}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to adhere to the inheritance and allow me to cast it to IEnumberable.</p>

<p>I'm completely stumped here.</p>

<p>Any ideas, recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

When debugging (with the <em>Debug</em> menu <kbd>F5</kbd>) a Visual Studio solution, a process called <code>MyApp.vshost.exe</code> is created. When you stop the debug <em>indecently</em> - I mean using the <em>Stop Debug</em> menu <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> and not waiting for a code line like <code>Application.Exit()</code> occurs - this process is not killed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you later start again debugging your application, an error message occurs, saying that the file (obviously, it is the file used by the debug: <code>bin\Debug\MyApp.vshost.exe</code>) is already in use.</p>

<p>That is why I added to the Build events this command line: <code>taskkill /F /IM MyApp.vshost.exe</code></p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
When the <code>MyApp.vshost.exe</code>process does not exist, Visual Studio is sometimes throwing an error at build time, thus preventing to build the application:  </p>

<pre><code>Error c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets
The command ""taskkill /F /IM MyApp.vshost.exe"" exited with code 128.

<p>The only existing solution i found is to remove the build event.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong><br>
Is there a way to resolve the error message without removing the build event?</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>I'm thinking the best solution would be to retrieve the return code (<code>errorlevel</code>) of the command, then return 0 if it is equal to 128. Is it possible to do it in the Build events of the project?</p>

Then, the uint32 indexed with 1035 / 32 is used with the bitposition 1035 % 32. I especially don't like the branching in the setbit function.</p>

<p>Here is my approach:</p>

<pre><code>void SetBit(uint32* data, const uint32 bitpos, const bool newval)
{
   if (newval)
   {
      //Set On
      data[bitpos &gt;&gt; 5u] |= (1u &lt;&lt; (31u - (bitpos &amp; 31u)));
      return;
   }
   else
   {
      //Set Off
      data[bitpos &gt;&gt; 5u] &amp;= ~(1u &lt;&lt; (31u - (bitpos &amp; 31u)));

<pre><code>Object[][] data = new Object[][] {
{ 1, 2, 3, new Blah() {{ setA(); }} }
{ 1, 2, 3, new Blah() {{ setB(); }} }

<p>Since the philosophy of JUnit is to call the test case constructor on each @Test, I was assuming that it would do the same with parameterized tests - but I'm seeing that it's only calling that constructor (the constructor defined for the parameterized test) once per row, not once per test per row.</p>

<p>So, the test fields are behaving globally and tests are affecting each other. I want to know if there's a way to force the runner to call the constructor for each tests, as with the regular JUnit runner.  Google and the JUnit pages are not helping me on this case. I'd really rather not rewrite the entire test, which is extensive and fairly readable at this point.</p>

<p>Relative to what?</p>

<p>Below is what I've gathered.</p>

<p>Countability it relative to:<br>
1. what a model takes to be $\mathbb N$<br>
2. what bijections between $\mathbb N$ and some set $A$ a model recognizes.</p>

<p>Two examples:  </p>

<p>For (1): Let $$ be a model such that $A$ is uncountable in $$.  We add a bijection between $A$ and $\mathbb N$ to $$ and call this new model $$. $A$ is countable in $$.  As mentioned <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/150234/a-quick-question-about-categoricity-in-model-theory/150267#150267"">here</a>.  </p>

<p>For (2): The underlying set of a model $$ might be countable from the perspective of a larger model $$, and so $$ might ""see"" $\mathbb N$ differently than $$. I'm not sure if I've said this right, but <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/150234/a-quick-question-about-categoricity-in-model-theory/150237#150237"">here</a> is a post on this.</p>

<p>(Note that I'm unfamiliar with the literature. If this issue is already explored, I'm unlikely to know that, and links to relevant papers would be appreciated.)</p>

<p>I'm defining a secure pseudo-random number generator as taking some constant-sized seed and generating a bit stream which is indistinguishable from random by a BPP adversary.</p>

<p>To show a bit-stream is pseudo-random, we just need to find an instance of X where using the bit stream as a random oracle when solving X gets the wrong answer too often. Such an instance must exist, or else X would be in P. To (probabilistically) determine that the wrong answer is being returned, we compare against using R as the entropy source.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that finding an appropriate instance of X might be too hard (obviously a fixed instance can't work), that assuming access to a true random oracle is a pretty strong condition, and probably other omitted details that might make things not work...</p>

<p>Is it suspected that $BPP \neq P$ implies that there are no secure PRNGs?</p>

"1142","Is a direct limit of topological groups always a topological group?","<p>If $(G_i,f_{ij})$ is a direct system of topological groups, is it always the case that the  topological\group-theoretical direct limit $G:=\varinjlim_iG_i$ is a topological group? (The topology on $G$ is the final topology with respect to the canonical homomorphisms $\psi_i:G_i\rightarrow G$). It is immediate from the group structure on $G$ and the definition of its topology that the inversion map is continuous. Moreover, I'm pretty certain that if the transition maps $f_{ij}$ are open, then the $\psi_i$ are open, and this gives continuity of multiplication. It's not at all clear to me that this condition is necessary though. </p>

<p>I have always sort of assumed that this was true, but it's never really been an issue because I never start with a system of topological groups and take the direct limit; I always have a topological group and express it as a direct limit (e.g. the idele group of a global field, or the Cartier dual of a finite free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module).</p>

"1147","All downloads being interrupted","<p><strong>System</strong>: Windows 7 Professional 64bit. 8GB RAM, Intel i5-2400 CPU, +300GB free on the hard drive. AVG Internet Security 2012 (enabled &amp; disabled, with firewall enabled and disabled - no effect for either). This computer is less than a year old.</p>

<p><strong>Network</strong>: This problem is occurring on a single computer on a network with multiple computers. The router is a Motorola Netopia 3347-02 (DSL Modem/Wireless Router combined). The computer is plugged in directly to the modem, other computers are using the wireless successfully. The router has been reset. The only thing odd about the connection between the router and computer is that it is configured to allow RDP through, so it is assigned a static IP by the router and port forwarding is enabled for port 3389. Also, though I doubt it matters, a second wireless router is active behind this router providing a second network that some computers in the area use without issues.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong>: All downloads initiated on this specific computer eventually fail, this includes streaming from youtube, specialized downloads (itunes), downloads from websites, FTP downloads, etc. Failure occurs with all browsers, but in chrome this is the process it takes: 1) Download begins normally, 2) At some point between (observed) 7MBs and 229MBs the download stops progressing (at this point, if watching chrome's task manager, you can see the network activity for the downloading tab drop to 0kps), 3) for some time the download sits there still attempting to complete, but will eventually display ""123,049,871/0 B, Interrupted"" (where the number is whatever it actually got to).</p>

<p>The file I am using to test this is a very large .zip file located on a server I control, but the problem seems to occur on any site. The amount downloaded is completely random, and seems to be more time-based than anything (if I start a download immediately after the last one fails, it tends to get further than the last one). Small files can get through for this reason, though they can fail as well. In a test where I simultaneously downloaded the same file via HTTP (chrome) and FTP (windows explorer), both downloads failed at the same instant, though explorer displayed ""Connection timed out"" several minutes before chrome finally showed the download as interrupted.</p>

"1152","Type.GetInterfaces() for declared interfaces only","<p>First of all, there are many questions just like this, and perhaps some OPs were even asking this exact same question. The problem is that no answer to those questions (accepted or not) actually answer this question, at least none that I can find.</p>

<p>How can I determine the interfaces a class declares directly, and not those inherited either by parents nor by the interfaces declared?</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>interface I {}
interface W : I {}
class C : W {}
class D : C, I {}
class E : D {}
</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>C</code> declares <code>W</code> </li>
<li><code>D</code> declares <code>I</code></li>
<li><code>E</code> declares none</li>
</ol>

<p>An acceptable solution could require the interfaces to have at least one method.</p>

<p>If you think it truly is impossible, be careful not to make <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4357729/use-reflection-to-invoke-a-overrided-base-method"">this</a> mistake, which actually <a href=""http://kennethxu.blogspot.com/2009/05/cnet-calling-grandparent-virtual-method.html"" rel=""nofollow"">can</a> be done.</p>

<p>The <code>InterfaceMap</code> handles many cases, but not all (I give an example below not solvable by <code>InterfaceMap</code>). One idea I had, but don't know how to implement it, is to decompile the bytecode of the class and see what is declared, as tools such as ILSpy correctly identify every case! If you like this idea, please give me a link to more info in this area.</p>

<p>I expect some of you will advise me to clean up my design. If this is not your argument, the rest of the post is not relevant for you. </p>

<p>Part of my project's purpose is in tracing potential code paths of given Types (at runtime). In order to determine programmatically which method will be called on a target type, without actually invoking the method nor creating an instance of the target type, knowing the declared interfaces of a target type is requisite to deterministically solve this. 'Nay' you say? Consider:</p>

<pre><code>interface I { int Foo(); }
class C : I { public int Foo() { return 1; } }
class D : C { public new int Foo() { return 2; } }
class E : D, I { }

C p = new E();
Assert.AreEqual(1 or 2, (p as I).Foo())
</code></pre>

<p>The correct answer is <code>2</code>, but if you change the declaration of <code>E</code> to not include <code>I</code> directly, the answer is <code>1</code>. Now sure this is edge case, but it is the correct answer too. My engine is therefore is not fully compatible with potential user code. Telling the users to clean their code in order to use my tool is not acceptable. (Note there are dozens more interesting rules with casting to an interface, but I'll not discuss them here).</p>

<p>At the moment, I have a working system which takes a ""Special"" from the db and displays it in the browser. The user is able to edit that ""Special"" in the browser and submit it to the db. That change is then shown to the user.</p>

<p>The problem is that the ""Special"" will not update if there is no pre-existing ""Special"" in the db. In my views.py I have:</p>

<pre><code>def changeSpecialOffer(theRequest):
    myProductUuid = theRequest.POST['myProductUuid']
    myNewSpecialOffer = theRequest.POST['myNewSpecialOffer']
    myProduct = get_object_or_404(Product, uuid=myProductUuid)
    myActiveSpecial = get_object_or_404(SpecialOffer.objects.filter(product=myProduct).filter(
                                                            active=True))
    try:
        myActiveSpecial.special = myNewSpecialOffer
        myActiveSpecial.save()
    except:
        return HttpResponse(myActiveSpecial, mimetype='text/plain')

                                                            active=True)
    return HttpResponse(myActiveSpecial, mimetype='text/plain')
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the reason the updating of the ""Special"" does not work is because the <code>get_object_or_404</code> is correctly returning a 404 error as there is no pre-existing ""Special"" in the db.</p>

<p>I've been trying for a while to work out the best way to get around this problem without breaking the function in cases where there is an existing ""Special"" in the db.</p>

The USB host subsystem works since I already hooked-up other devices (capacitive touch screen etc).

After I boot, I see the device on my USB HUB with the proper, manufacturer, VID, PID, with 4 interfaces. 
  When I plug the MODEM, I have the following message on the terminal:</p>

In addition I lost 4 power-cords in a short period of time (a couple of months) to - I suspect - the laptop charger.</p>

<p>The power cords lost happened the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>one shorted out in the middle of the cord an burned a hole</li>
<li>one simply shorted out when plugging in (probably at the switch)</li>
<li>two shorted out when switching on (they were off, I plugged in the charger and turned them on)</li>

<p>(Google isn't quite clearing up my confusion.) Is the following correct/am I missing anything?</p>

<p>An irreducible Markov chain (finite or countably infinite) has a unique equilibrium distribution if and only if all states are positive recurrent. (What about reducible Markov chains? A reducible Markov chain has a non-unique equilibrium distribution iff all states are positive recurrent?) However, not all starting states necessarily converge to the unique equilibrium, unless the Markov chain is also aperiodic; that is, an irreducible Markov chain converges to its unique equilibrium regardless of initial state, if and only if all states are positive recurrent and aperiodic.</p>

"1179","Access Visual C++ DLL from Python (__thiscall calling convention)","<p>I want to access a class in a closed-source DLL from Python, compiled with Visual C++.
I have no header files, just the object code and no interface descriptions.</p>

<p>I can load the DLL using <code>ctypes.CDLL</code>, but any attempt to call a function results in an access violation. Apparently ctypes doesn't know about the <code>__thiscall</code> calling convention (it's not designed for C++ anyway). Usually, I'd simply write an extension module, but without source code I'm out of luck here.</p>

<p>This is what MSDN says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The __thiscall calling convention is used on member functions and is
  the default calling convention used by C++ member functions that do
  not use variable arguments. Under __thiscall, the callee cleans the
  stack, which is impossible for vararg functions. Arguments are pushed
  on the stack from right to left, with the this pointer being passed
  via register ECX, and not on the stack, on the x86 architecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, this is how the exported function signature looks (unmangled):</p>

<p><code>public: __thiscall CFoo::CFoo(void)</code></p>

<p>My attempt to access the constructor from Python:</p>

<pre><code>getattr(dll, ""??0CFoo@@QAE@XZ"")(c_voidp())
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work because ctypes doesn't pass the instance pointer, and all I get is an access violation.</p>

<p>I guess that I can't easily do this because ctypes has no C++ support, and as every compiler has its own name mangling conventions, it would be difficult to implement it in a generic way. The <code>__thiscall</code> calling convention is not implemented by ctypes.</p>

<p>The obvious workaround would be a wrapper, written in Visual C++, which exports the function as <code>__stdcall</code>, but I don't want to rely on this.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to reload the variable into Flash real-time when the user changes the drop-down box selection?</strong></p>

"1183","How to reference an attribute being passed from form_for in controller","<p>This is my first time creating a custom action so I'm a bit lost. I created a form where I enter a URL. This URL is passed to my controller where I use the URL to parse html (via Nokogiri).</p>

<p>The problem I am having is that I have no idea how to use this URL parameter that is being passed.</p>

<p>Here is the action in my controller:</p>

<pre><code>def newdeal

 url = @traveldeal.url   #this is where I want to use the URL from my form_for
 doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))

<p>The error I'm getting is <code>undefined method 'url'</code>. I've tried doing something like <code>url = :url</code> and even <code>url = ""#{:url}""</code>, but I get nil class error, so it appears that I'm just referencing it incorrectly.</p>

<p>Now I've coded this algorithm. I would like to improve it and find little mistakes which could be in it. I don't want to discuss how to solve it - as we did in the last question. Now I only want to improve it. Can you help me again please?</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any mistakes?</li>
<li>Is the structure of the nested if-clauses ok? Could it be improved?</li>
<li>Are the tactics integrated correctly according to my description?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Tactical settings which should have an influence on the randomness:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>$tactics[x][0] adjustment (1=defensive, 2=neutral, 3=offensive): the higher the value is the weaker is the defense and the stronger is the offense</li>
<li>$tactics<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1427043/soccer-simulation-for-a-game"">x</a> speed of play (1=slow, 2=medium, 3=fast): the higher the value is the better are the opportunities but the higher is the risk of getting a quick counter attack</li>
<li>$tactics[x][2] distance of passes (1=short, 2=medium, 3=long): the higher the value is the less but better opportunities you get and the more often you are offside</li>
<li>$tactics[x][3] creation of changes (1=safe, 2=medium, 3=risky): the higher the value is the better are your opportunities but the higher is the risk of getting a quick counter attack</li>
<li>$tactics[x][4] pressure in defense (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): the higher the value is the more quick counter attacks you will have</li>
<li>$tactics[x][5] aggressivity (1=low, 2=medium, 3=high): the higher the value is the more attacks you will stop by fouls</li>

<p>The functions are constructed using PHP's ""Variable Function Name"" ability, so it is possible. Arguments are taken in as arrays since there is no reasonable way to glue them togather the way that PHP needs to parse them as.

"1199","Using function objects in parallel_for","<p>I just barely learned how to use a function in parallel. The following line of code calculates the square value of an index and places it in an array (called squares) at that index. The parallel_for function is available in Visual Studio 2010, as part of the Concurrency namespace under the  header.</p>

<pre><code>parallel_for(static_cast&lt;size_t&gt;(0), count, 
    [&amp;squares](size_t n) { squares[n] = (n+1)*(n+1); });
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that it uses a lambda expression to calculate the squares in parallel, and this code does work and compile correctly. However, the lambda expression clutters the parallel_for function with code. I was thinking of just defining the lambda expression within a function object, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function&lt;void(size_t)&gt; Squares = 
    [&amp;squares](size_t n) { squares[n] = (n+1)*(n+1); };
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how can I use this function (Squares) within the parallel_for function? Did I write the Squares function incorrectly, or is this just a paradigm of the parallel_for to use lambda expression? You can go ahead and recommend some other parallel libraries to me other than Microsoft's, but I'd still like to know the answer to my question.</p>

<pre><code>public interface IModelProcessor {

<p>So, each plugin which wants to usw that Extensionppoint has to provide an IModelProcessor with processModel(Object diagramModel). My Question is:</p>

<pre><code>public ReturnContainer processModel(Object diagramModel);

<p>But since not every plug-in will deliver a return value, I'd had to make the convention, that plug-ins should return null in this case, which is in my opinion rather dirty.
What you think about that:</p>

<pre><code>public void processModel(Object diagramModel, Observer returnObserver);

<p>So, each plug-in which wants to deliver return values can register that Observer (ofc, the plug-in would have to be Observable) and call the update method on it. What you think about that?</p>

"1209","Emulating variance in .NET 3.5 delegates","<p>I have a method that given a delegate <code>Type</code> argument (not a generic), it returns a <code>Delegate</code> that it created that implements the signature. It internally creates a dynamic method using Expression trees. The delegate type must be of this form <code>Func&lt;SomeParam,IamDerivedObject&gt;</code>,a func where IamDerivedObject is an inheritor of IamDerivedObject. The method uses the type information to figure out which object to instance, so simply using the interface for creation would be disastrous. The calling is done from a static method that returns <code>IamDerivedObject</code>.</p>

<p>In .NET 4 code, I can do this::
<code>var myDelegate = MakeMethod(typeArgument) as Func&lt;SomeParam,IamDerivedObject&gt;</code></p>

<p>In .Net 3.5 this does not work. And I'm stuck with having to know the type to call the invoke method, or using another expression generated delegate to invoke it and cache that delegate. This means more runtime generated code.
Unfortunately, I cannot use the .NET 4 code as the assembly for the time being must be .NET 3.5 code as it relies on a third party dll which does not work in 4.0.</p>

<p>The problem now is that I have two monitors, generally with a maximized visual studio on the left and a maximized Firefox on the right.  All that darkness I'm getting from Visual Studio now is being overshadowed (pun intended) by the brightness of the Firefox window next to it.</p>

<p>Installing a dark theme for Firefox would help a little, but it's mostly the content of web pages that's the problem, not the chrome around them.  So I had a thought that it would be useful if Firefox could just go dark when I focus on another window (i.e. turn down the brightness on the content pane so white backgrounds become gray, etc).

"1213","Including all libraries, audio, etc. of a Java program in one JAR file","<p>I am using Netbeans and I am trying to figure out how I can put all of my libraries, music, images, etc. in one JAR file for distribution.  I think I have the libraries figured out, but the audio, images, and other such files are giving me trouble.</p>

<p>In my current project I have an audio file that I want to embed in the JAR file too.  First I tried <code>one-jar</code> but after a couple of hours I gave up on it.  I put the audio file into the JAR file just fine, but I cannot access it from my program.  I know I need to use <code>getResourceAsStream</code> as suggested <a href=""http://capturevision.wordpress.com/2008/06/28/how-to-embed-resource-files-using-netbeans/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> but I am unclear what I do after I get the input stream.  The only way I can see to make it work is to use use the <code>InputStream</code> and create a whole new file (seen below... and it works), <strong>but creating a new file seems like a waste</strong> (and I don't want people to see an audio file appear when my program is running).  <strong>Is there no way to directly access the audio file while it is still contained in the <code>.JAR</code> file?</strong></p>

<pre><code>File file = new File(""myAudio.wav"");
InputStream stream = mypackage.MyApp.class.getResourceAsStream(""audio/myAudio.wav"");
        try {
            OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);
            byte buf[] = new byte[1024];
            int len;
            while ((len = inputStream.read(buf)) &gt; 0) {
                out.write(buf, 0, len);
            }
            out.close();
            inputStream.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
        }

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The internal structure of my JAR file Contains 1.) a library package (<a href=""http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/"" rel=""nofollow"">Jama</a>), 2.) my package which is the direct parent of my class files and a folder called ""audio"" which contains <code>myAudio.wav</code>, and 3.) a <code>META-INF</code> folder which contains my <code>manifest.mf</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Audio stream is read something like this.  I have tried to use the <code>InputStream</code> directly but I have not had success.  I want to point out again that I already have it when I create a new audio file from the input stream of the audio file contained <code>JAR</code> file, but like I said before, it seems like a waste to create a big audio file every time a program is run when the file already exists in the <code>JAR</code>.  This file recreation is what I am trying to avoid.</p>

<p>pretty much all the traditional RDBM operations (JOINS, GROUP BY, HAVING, etc) can be done in NoSQL databases through a combination of MapReduce/denormalization techniques.</p>

<p>Is there any article/document that has all these equivalences clearly described. Something like... the equivalence of a JOIN in a NoSQL database would be... bla bla</p>

"1228","Safe way to initialize a derived class","<p>I have a base class:</p>

<pre><code>class CBase {
   public:
      virtual void SomeChecks() {}
      CBase() {
         /* Do some checks */
         SomeChecks();
         /* Do some more checks */
      }
};
</code></pre>

<p>and a derived class:</p>

<pre><code>class CDerived : public CBase {
   public:
      virtual void SomeChecks() { /* Do some other checks */ }
      CDerived() : CBase() {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>This construction seems to be a bit weird but in my case this is required, because CBase does some checks and CDerived can mix some checks in between them. You can see it as a way to ""hook"" functions in the constructor.
The problem with this construction is that while constructing CDerived first a CBase is constructed and there is no awareness of CDerived (so overloaded function SomeChecks() is not called).</p>

<p>I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class CBase {
   public:
      void Init() {
         /* Do some checks */
         SomeChecks();
         /* Do some more checks */
      }
      virtual void SomeChecks() {}
      CBase(bool bDoInit=true) {
         if (bDoInit) { Init(); }
      }
};
class CDerived : public CBase {
   public:
      virtual void SomeChecks() { /* Do some other checks */ }
      CDerived() : CBase(false) { Init() }
};
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't really safe, because I want the constructor with the false parameter be protected, so only derived classes can call it.
But then I'll have to create a second constructor (that is protected) and make it take other parameters (probably unused because is constructor is called when Init() does not have to be called).</p>

<p>So I'm quite stuck here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Actually I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class CBase {
   protected:
      void Init() { /* Implementation of Init ... */ }
      CBase() { /* Don't do the Init(), it is called by derived class */ }
   public:
      CBase() { Init(); }     // Called when an object of CBase is created
};
class CDerived : public CBase {
   public:
      CDerived() : CBase() { Init(); }
};
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me it is impossible to have 2 constructors with the same arguments being protected and public?</p>

"1246","Returning images/HTML using custom URI protocol on Android","<p>I'm wondering if it's possible to return web content through Android's ability to register custom URI protocols for launching apps, rather than launching the app itself, such that myapp://images/logo.png will return the image logo.png to a WebView</p>

<p>I'm working on a tool for a company to open document libraries in Android. The libraries are just zip files with HTML, images, XML, etc.. The desktop version uses a custom URI protocol handler already, so as a result all the HTML files in the library are hard-coded to use it.</p>

<p>Is there any way of implementing this? I'd rather not modify the DOM on load by injecting JavaScript, but from searching around it seems like the only way. Hopefully someone here will be able to tell me otherwise.</p>

"1269","on hover, div takes over entire li","<p>I've got an unordered list, with each li containing an img and a div. My goal is that hovering over the div will make the img do something. For now it's just add/remove class, but that's a placeholder. The add/remove works, but it's not the problem (though if you have tips about that, always happy to get input from anyone more experienced). </p>

<p>The issue is that the hovered-div, upon hovering, suddenly expands to fill the entire li, and also appears to lose its upper padding temporarily. Which means that when that div is replaced with a fancy button... the button will likely jump just as much as the current plain text. </p>

<p>The html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""headmenu""&gt;
    &lt;li id=""kite1""&gt;
        &lt;img src=""img/kitesani1a.png"" id=""kites1a"" /&gt;
        &lt;div id=""attend"" class=""headmenulink""&gt;attending&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The css:</p>

<pre><code>ul#headmenu { margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0; }
ul#headmenu li { margin: 0 1% 0 0; padding: 0; width: 19%; float: left; display: inline; list-style: none;}
ul#headmenu img { padding-bottom: 5em; position: relative; top: 0; left: 0; z-index: 100; }
li .headmenulink { padding-top: 2em; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; border:1px solid blue; }

ul#headmenu li img {
    transition-duration: 0.8s;
    transition-property: transform;
}

.kite1ahover {
    float: right;
    position: relative;
    -webkit-transform:rotate(10deg);
    -moz-transform:rotate(10deg);
}
</code></pre>

<p>(In the live versions, the css is more verbose.) Last, the current draft jQuery bits:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#attend"").hover(function(){
    $(""#kites1a"").addClass('kite1ahover').delay(500).queue(function(next){
        $(this).removeClass('kite1ahover');
        next();
});
</code></pre>

<p>I did a jsfiddle at but it's giving me strange errors. Not sure if it'll work to edit, but just in case, it's at <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/klh02/5UMK5/7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/klh02/5UMK5/7/</a> -- then I also did a stripped-down real-world example, at <a href=""http://www.karinoyo.com/temp/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.karinoyo.com/temp/index.php</a>. If you open the live version (not the fiddle), you'll see the temporary blue border expand on hover, at the same time the text jumps up a line or two. (note: the only 'live' hover is on the 'attending' li, first li from the left.)</p>

<p>Is the expanding div because of the CSS? or is it because of the jQuery? or is this just something that happens in a case like this, and I'll need to do some creative positioning to get the div to stay put instead of expanding/jumping?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

""Oh and what I was referring to, was basically that if I changed the align, it would affect both LoginForm and Image..

"1274","XNA - How to access a texture from .x model?","<p>I am just getting into XNA programming and have been unable to figure out how can I access the texture from a "".x"" model.  I am using a custom shader to display my model (just a cube with a texture mapped on it) with the filters set to point. To do this I needed to pass the effect my texture file which needed to be imported separately from my model or else it would complain since it is included in my model as well.  This works perfectly how I want it, however this isn't really an agreeable method when I have many different models with their own textures.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> </p>

<p>How am I able to access the texture included in my model directly from it and send that to my shader? Or am I able to access it directly with HLSL? </p>

<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>

<p>I have found posts saying that it can assigned to a texture variable with: </p>

<p><code>Texture2d texture = ((BasicEffect)model.Meshes[0].Effects[0]).Texture</code></p>

<p>When I tried this the game runs but the cubes are just black.  I can see that the texture variable is holding info and has the right dimensions but I can't tell if it is correctly holding the actual image. When I used just the <code>BasicEffect</code> they rendered just fine with their texture.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I have managed to get this to work after a little bit of fiddling. My game loads in a few hundred of the same cube and upon creation of each it would try save the texture of the model using the code above and then go through the mesh parts and change the effects to my custom effect. I discovered that the first cube created would save the texture okay but any subsequent cubes created would complain that they can't be cast as a BasicEffect. This resulted in one textured cube and then a lot of black ones. I am guessing that when it reuses the same model over and over like that it will just use the one that was modified to use my custom effect which was done on the first instance of the cube.  Is this normal?  I have got them all to render as textured by changing the texture variable to static.</p>

For example, if you have a text input and you don't want the user to be able to add a character, you can call <code>e.preventDefault()</code> with the jQuery-normalised event object on the <code>keydown</code> event. However, there is no way to programatically verify this test scenario.</p>

Unfortunately libmcrypt is not available via the default CentOS repo, and I don't feel comfortable following the steps outlined @ <a href=""http://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/RPMForge#head-f0c3ecee3dbb407e4eed79a56ec0ae92d1398e01"" rel=""nofollow"">CentOS</a> wiki.</p>

<p>I am quite comfortable compiling libraries manually, but I can't seem to find a trusted source from which to download the libmcrypt source file. I did come across the file @ <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcrypt/files/Libmcrypt/"" rel=""nofollow"">sourceforge</a>, but when I attempt to compile, it complained that it couldn't find a local install of libmcrypt. </p>

"1279","Entity framework - Intensive CPU load on Add","<p>I have small project with about 20 tables where row entries are of minimal contents size but there are plenty of relationships between the tables.</p>

<p>I'm using code first with all my navigational properties being set as virtual.</p>

<p>Today I've noticed that when I'm adding entity to DbSet with Add method, and entity has about 6-7 foreign keys, adding roughly 2000 entities just to DbContext (without doing SaveChanges) takes about 30 seconds and CPU is stuck at 100%.</p>

<pre><code>for ($i = 0, $count = count($array); $i &lt; $c; ++$i)
{
    // Do stuff while traversing array
}

<pre><code>for ($i = 0; $i &lt; count($array); ++$i)
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>for performance reasons (i.e. initializing <code>$count</code> would've called <code>count()</code> only once, instead of calling <code>count()</code> with every conditional check).</p>

<p>Does it then also make a difference if, in a <code>foreach</code> loop, I do this:</p>

<pre><code>$array = do_something_that_returns_an_array();

foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $val)

{

"1284","latency measurement on Linux-based router using tcpdump","<p>I am using tcpdump to measure latency on a linux router, i.e. the delay experienced by packets as they pass through the router (made of Ubuntu 10). For this purpose, I captured packets in the IN and Out interfaces and subtracted their log timestamp to know the latency inside the router. I was expecting some sort of flat latency; but, in constrast, the latency increased linearly with time. I used iperf to send about 800,000 packets (of size 1500Byte) through the router (having two Gibabit links).</p>

<p>The surprising point is that although the latency on the router was increasing from about 20 microseconds to 7 milliseconds, the average throughput measured every second was almost flat. </p>

<p>Would you please let me know why the latency has increased? There might be some problem in properly recording the time of capturing OUT interface packets. </p>

"1298","using java mail message object between web applications","<p>I'm developing a web application which acts as an email client for mobile. In this application user can login and provide numerous email ids for monitoring.There are two main classes in the web application. 1.MailGetter 2.MailFormatter</p>

<p>Behaviour of MailGetter class:</p>

<ol>
<li>Timertask initiated which will execute for every 10 minutes</li>
<li>Obtains the numerous email ids from database which are provided for monitoring</li>
<li>establishes connection with mail server for the first email id and obtains recently arrived email message object</li>
<li>passes the message object to MailFormatter class</li>
</ol>

<p>Behavior of MailFormatter class:</p>

<ol>
<li>parses the email message object</li>
<li>various recursive calls made if the message has many multiparts inorder to parse parts one by one</li>
<li>downloads also attachments along with this message</li>
<li>returns an xml string to the MailGetter class which will be stored as simple text file with the following content:</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mail&gt;
&lt;from&gt;FromEmailID&lt;/from&gt;
&lt;to&gt;ToEmailID&lt;/to&gt;
&lt;subject&gt;Subject&lt;/subject&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Email Body&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;attachments&gt;
  attachment
&lt;/attachments&gt;
&lt;/mail&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>MobileResponderServlet: A separate servlet is also coded in the web application which will read the simple xml text file and send the read content to mobile</p>

<p>The main demerit of this application might be ""MailGetter"" class will be waiting until all the functions (including recursive calls) of ""MailFormatter"" class finishes execution.Once the control is returned from ""MailFormatter"" class to ""MailGetter"" class, it will obtain the next message object from mail server and passes it to ""MailFormatter"" class.So intimating about new emails to the mobile user consumes time. Even when ""MailFormatter"" class is implemented as a separate thread,consider in a case if there are 1000 new emails in a single inbox (for a single emailid) which will be invocating 1000 ""MailFormatter"" threads, which will make the process more resource intensive.</p>

<p>So I'm deciding to unplug ""MailFormatter"" from ""MailGetter"". ""MailGetter"" will be running as a separate web application in one server whereas ""MailFormatter"" will be running as a separate web application in another server. After obtaining the recent email message object ""MailGetter"" web application persists (via message.writeTo(FileOutputstream)) the message object in a location which is also common to ""MailFormatter"". ""MailFormatter"" class then reads (via MimeMessage(Session,InputStream) constructor) and parses the message object one by one and then stores the ""XML Content"" in another location which will be read by ""MobileResponderServlet"" and sent to mobile.</p>

<p>Will this process be efficient in real time? Will this be arising problems especially while sharing message objects between ""MailGetter"" and ""MailFormatter"" web applications? Please do let me know if there are any other ways. This web application will be handling more than 5000 users (minimum) who have provided numerous email ids for monitoring.</p>

"1312","Web-service with attachment failed on 2-ways SSL connection","<p>I have two applications, one that provides a Web-service (let's call it <code>ws-provider</code>), the other one that is the client of this Web-Service (call it <code>ws-client</code>).
This communication is protected through a 2-ways SSL. Both servers have been correctly configured regarding this confidentiality restrictions (certificates installation, SSL configuration, Tomcat parametrization...)</p>

<p>The servers are running on Tomcat (5.5 for <code>ws-provider</code>, 6 for <code>ws-client</code>), Java 6 and uses Jax-WS for providing/consuming the web-service.</p>

<p>When the user connects to the <code>ws-client</code> application and executes the action that calls the <code>ws-provider</code> web-service, the latter action <em>generally</em> fails with the following error:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>On the <code>ws-provider</code>, I get this error:</p>

<pre><code>WARNING: Exception getting SSL attributes
java.net.SocketException: SSL Cert handshake timeout
        at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSE14Support.synchronousHandshake(JSSE14Support.java:101)

</code></pre>

<p>Now, the strange part is that I just said that it <strong>generally</strong> failed when calling the web-service.
For some reasons, sometimes I get a successfull attempt when calling the web-service. This generally happens if the user launches the action in the minute that follows his login to the application (No, I don't know why!)...</p>

<p>The web-service request contains an attachment. This attachment is a PDF file that is not bigger than 15Kb (at least during all my tests, successfull or failed, this size was never exceeded).</p>

<p>So after many tests, I tried to call the same web-service <strong>without</strong> attaching any PDF file, and the call was successfull.</p>

<p>For your information, if the security constraints are disabled on the <code>ws-provider</code> (i.e. we do not use 2-ways SSL connexion anymore) then the web-service calls never fail.</p>

<p>So I imagine that I have to configure something on my web-services or on Tomcat (or ?) to make the system working.
Any idea? </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Java code</strong></p>

<p>Here is the Java interface that provides the method call on <code>ws-client</code> (as you can see, the core Java classes used for the WS are generated by Jax-WS library):</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * This class was generated by the JAX-WS RI.
 * JAX-WS RI 2.1.3-b02-
 * Generated source version: 2.1

 */
@WebService(name = ""PushServicePortType"", targetNamespace = ""http://my.app.ws/PushService"")
@XmlSeeAlso({
    ObjectFactory.class
})
public interface PushServicePortType {


    @WebMethod
    @WebResult(name = ""response"", targetNamespace = """")
    @RequestWrapper(localName = ""createOrRenewRequest"", targetNamespace = ""http://my.app.ws/CwfPushService"", className = ""my.app.CreateOrRenewRequest"")
    @ResponseWrapper(localName = ""createOrRenewRequestResponse"", targetNamespace = ""http://my.app.ws/CwfPushService"", className = ""my.app.CreateOrRenewRequestResponse"")

        String version,
        @WebParam(name = ""attachments"", targetNamespace = """")
        List&lt;DataHandler&gt; attachments);

}
</code></pre>

<p>The call on <code>ws-client</code> is as follow (<code>xmlFile</code> contains the XML for the request, <code>datahandler</code> is a <code>javax.activation.DataHandler</code> that contains the PDF attachment):</p>

<pre><code>PushServicePortType pushServicePort = new PushService(new URL(""url/to/wsdl""), new QName(""http://my.app.ws/PushService"", ""PushService"")).getPushServiceSOAP(new MTOMFeature());
PushRequest push = new PushRequest();
responseXML = push.sendXMLRequest(pushServicePort, xmlFile, datahandler);
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>There are lots of configuration files, logs or Java classes. So do not hesitate to ask for more details if needed!</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>I've tried to force the integration of the PDF file within the SOAP message, by defining the <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E12840_01/wls/docs103/webserv_adv/mtom.html#wp279634"" rel=""nofollow"">MTOM threshold</a> to 2Mb:</p>

<p>On <code>ws-client</code>:</p>

<pre><code>PushServicePortType pushServicePort = new PushService(new URL(""url/to/wsdl""), new QName(""http://my.app.ws/PushService"", ""PushService"")).getPushServiceSOAP(new MTOMFeature(2097152));
</code></pre>

<p>On <code>ws-provider</code>, I configured the MTOM annotation with <code>@MTOM(threshold=2097152)</code></p>

<p>This correction did <strong>not</strong> solve my issue, unfortunately...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>I've removed the PDF attachment from my web-service all, and now it also fails but with a different message:</p>

The suggested practice, as I saw, is using POCO with Entity Framework and also using POCO classes as DataContracts. That is actually what POCO and Attributes are used for, -if I am not wrong.</p>

<p>However I am asked to use seperate classses for Entity Framework POCO's and WCF DataContracts. And to use a mapper between POCO's and DataContracts. Like, <code>Foo</code> and <code>FooContract</code> with same properties.</p>

<p>I am on the first approachs side but I wonder if the second approach (seperate classes approach) provides flexibility to the application or is it just a waste of effort.</p>

<p>I will be grateful if you can share your thoughts and experiences about using seperate classes for POCO and DataContracts, pros and cons about that. </p>

"1324","Mozilla Builder editor unescaping Unicode characters, concurrent w. failed AMO uploads","<p>Having a devil of a time uploading latest revision of my Firefox add-on to AMO from builder.addons.mozilla.org.  Getting the ""upload failed"" message.  One thing that's different this revision is an escaped Unicode character in some HTML code used as the <code>content</code> property of a <code>widget</code> object.  The character unescapes in the online editor as soon as the string literal is closed with a closing quote.  The characters in the escape code are apparently included when the cursor column is calculated so the cursor is hovering a few spaces right of the rightmost character in the line.  Copying the affected text from the online editor to gedit (a plaintext editor) reveals the escape sequence, not the Unicode character.</p>

Having asked around on the IRC channel and looked here, the number 1 cause of such problems is inadvertently holding onto the head; but I can't see where I'm doing this.</p>

<p>The code is quite simple; here's a version which displays the problem:</p>

<pre><code>(def atoms '(a b c))

(defn get-ch [n] (map #(str n %) atoms)) 

(defn add-ch 
  ([] (apply concat (iterate add-ch atoms))) 
  ([n] (mapcat get-ch n)))

(dorun (take 20000000 (add-ch)))
</code></pre>

<p>And here's another version (which is the one I started out with before getting help from #clojure), which displays the same issue:</p>

<pre><code>(def atoms '(a b c))

(defn get-children [n] (map #(str n %) atoms))

(defn add-layer 
  ([] (add-layer atoms)) 
  ([n] (let [child-nodes (mapcat get-children n) ] 
      (lazy-seq (concat n (add-layer child-nodes))))))

</code></pre>

<p>Both give me an ""OutOfMemoryError Java heap space"". I'm running them from the REPL in Eclipse/CounterClockwise, on a Macbook Air.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to Clojure, so after beating my head against this for a day I'm hoping that this is something trivial I'm overlooking. I realise I could up my heap-size to make the issue less likely to occur, but the sequences I ultimately want to process are so vast I don't think this is going to help me.</p>

"1346","sqlalchemy: joining to the same table multiple times using declarative and reflection","<p>Here is a trimmed down version of my problem: </p>

<p>Consider that I have two tables: 'procedure' and 'role'.</p>

<p>role has fields: (role_uid, role_name)</p>

<p>procedure has fields: (procedure_uid, procedure_name, inform_role_uid, consult_role_uid)</p>

<p>So 'role' has two one-to-many relationships with 'procedure'.</p>

<p>Some code:</p>

<pre><code>class Role(Base):
    __tablename__ = ""role""
    __table_args__ = ({'autoload':True, 'useexisting': True})

class Procedure(Base):
    __tablename__ = ""procedure""
    __table_args__ = (sqlalchemy.ForeignKeyConstraint(['consult_role_uid','inform_role_uid'],['role.role_uid', 'role.role_uid']),
        {'autoload':True, 'useexisting': True})

Procedure.consult_role = sqlalchemy.orm.relationship(Role,
 primaryjoin=""Procedure.consult_role_uid==Role.role_uid"", foreign_keys=Role.role_uid)
Procedure.inform_role = sqlalchemy.orm.relationship(Role,
 primaryjoin=""Procedure.inform_role_uid==Role.role_uid"", foreign_keys=Role.role_uid)

consult_role = sqlalchemy.orm.aliased(Role, name=""consult_role"")
inform_role = sqlalchemy.orm.aliased(Role, name=""inform_role"")

query = session.query(
    Procedure.procedure_name, 
    consult_role.role_name.label(""consult_role_name""),
    inform_role.role_name.label(""inform_role_name"")).join(consult_role, inform_role)
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the following SQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  `procedure`.procedure_name AS procedure_procedure_name, 
  consult_role.role_name AS consult_role_name, 
  inform_role.role_name AS inform_role_name 
FROM 
  `procedure` 
  INNER JOIN role AS consult_role 
    ON consult_role.role_uid = `procedure`.consult_role_uid
      AND consult_role.role_uid = `procedure`.inform_role_uid 
  INNER JOIN role AS inform_role 
    ON inform_role.role_uid = `procedure`.consult_role_uid 
      AND inform_role.role_uid = `procedure`.inform_role_uid
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I had no intention of EACH of the inner joins to join on both the fields.
Why does it seem to be ignoring my 'primaryjoin' argument?</p>

"1353","Quotient metric spaces: pseudo metrics versus metrics","<p>I got the following definition from wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If $M$ is a metric space with metric $d$, and $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $M$, then we can endow the quotient set $M/{\sim}$ with the following (pseudo)metric. Given two equivalence classes $[x]$ and $[y]$, we define $$ d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+\dotsb+d(p_{n},q_{n})\} $$ 
  where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences $(p_1, p_2,\dots, p_n)$ and $(q_1, q_2,\dots, q_n)$ with $[p_1]=[x], [q_n]=[y],[q_i]=[p_{i+1}], i=1,2,\dots, n-1$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder when does this define a pseudo metric and when does it define a metric?
I cannot see how this can define a pseudo metric because the equivalence relationship partitions $M$ in equivalence classes which are disjoint sets in $M$ and $d(,)$ is a metric for $M$. What I am missing?
Is there a good text book to read up on this? </p>

<p>I have done probes and I get some doubts.</p>

<p>How long doe it take to transfer the file? I have the service in one virtual machine and the client in the principal operative system. I ask this because at a first time I have set my binding to 1 minute the timeouts, but this is not enough time to transfer the entire file. So I set 10 minutes and now I have time to transfer all the file, the problem is that transfer more the the size of the file.</p>

<p>So, how is it possible that the transfer takes this time? About 3 minutes  to transfer the 5MB. And why I continue to receive data once it has transferred all?</p>

<p>So I would like to know two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I improve the speed of the transfer? 3 minutes for 5MB I think is a lot of time.</p></li>
<li><p>How can I know when I receive the all data I stop the transfer?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am using two files as log to know that I still receive data beyond the size of the original file. One file is a text file and other a binary file.</p>

<p>This code is in the service side, it is the way that I am trying to create the file from the stream that I receive from the client:</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.StreamWriter file = new System.IO.StreamWriter(""c:\\log.txt"");
    FileStream fs = File.Create(""C:\\binary.dat"", 2048, FileOptions.None);
    BinaryWriter bw = new BinaryWriter(fs);

    dato = paramFichero.Fichero.ReadByte();
    file.WriteLine(dato.ToString());
    bw.Write(dato);
    while (dato != -1)
    {
         datoBinario = Convert.ToByte(dato);
         miFicheroAux.Add(datoBinario);
         dato = paramFichero.Fichero.ReadByte();

"1366","Finalize first element of an array","<p>Say, I have some class which holds an array of integers in it.</p>

<pre><code>Integer[] numbers;

<p>Also, I have some simple constructor which initializes my array:</p>

<pre><code>public Program()

<p>As you can see, I have an array of <code>11</code> elements.</p>

"1371","Render target for each scene, for transitions","<p>I'm trying to come up with a general concept for transitions, without having to include any specific code inside the actual scene. In all the samples I've seen so far the scenes handle that stuff themselves. Like a fade in/out, where the scenes have to adjust their draw method, for the correct transparency. But not only would this be annoying to have in every scene, with multiple kinds of transitions you'd get cluttered code pretty fast.</p>

<p>So I've been thinking. The only way I could come up with to support this, and more complicated transitions, without handling it in the scene itself, are render targets for each scene. The render target would be set from the scene manager before calling the draw method. After draw the render target would get reset to the render target of the manager, and the scene's texture would get drawn with information about the current transition. Without clearing the manager texture more scenes would follow, if more have to be drawn. This way you could do pretty much anything (transition wise), the scenes would be completely independent of each other, and you wouldn't need a single line of transition code in the actual scenes. (For reference, there are various transition types I'd like to be able to do. Not only fades, but also shader effects, moving one scene in while the current one is ""pushed away"", etc., involving one or multiple scenes.)</p>

<p>Well, that's my theory. Here comes my question: Does this sound like a viable plan? Is this the way to go? I've read about performance problems when switching rendering targets too frequently, and other problems, which is the main reason I'm hesitating to implement this. But so far I couldn't think of or find a better method. Although I think it shouldn't make a difference, for the moment I only care about 2D (mentioned just in case).</p>

"1376","What can I not symlink/mklink in the windows folder (i.e. prevent booting)","<p>I have a huge project.  I got the scripting down.  The script dumps to a .txt file a list of all files under or over a certain size.  I then move the files to another hd (depending on how I setup my boot drive) and then delete the original and make a symlink to it.</p>

<p>I've tried it on Program Files and Program Files (x86) and Users perfectly.  However, when I do the Windows drive I'll get a BCD boot error.</p>

"1388","Elegant way to implement press and hold continuous event firing?","<p>I often have a need to fire a sequence of events as a result of holding down a button. Think of a <code>+</code> button that increments a field: tapping it should increment it by 1, but tap &amp; hold should say increment this by 1 every second until the button is released. Another example is the scrubbing function when holding down the backwards or forwards button in an audio player type app.</p>

<p>I usually resort to the following strategy:</p>

<ol>
<li>On <code>touchDownInside</code> I set up a repeating timer with my desired interval.</li>
<li>On <code>touchUpInside</code> I invalidate and release the timer.</li>
</ol>

<p>But for every such button I need a separate timer instance variable, and 2 target-actions, and 2 method implementations. (This is assuming I'm writing a generic class and don't want to impose restrictions on the max number of simultaneous touches).</p>

<p>Is there a more elegant way to solve this that I'm missing?</p>

"1389","Simple reusable javascript averaging function for multiple forms on same page","<p>I literally started trying to teach myself javascript less than 48 hours ago.  Outside of just wanting to learn it I also have a small personal project I'm working on and using as sort of my working learn as I go example.  But I've hit a problem, which I'm sure is rather basic, I'm just hampered by lack of much javascript knowledge.  </p>

<p>Basically it is just an averaging problem.<br>
There are going to be 4 inputs fields with the 4th being a rounded to the nearest whole number average of the first three fields.<br>
This 4 field configuration is going to get used multiple times on the page.<br>
I want it to work in ""real time"" and not with a calculate button so I'm assuming ""<strong>onKeyup</strong>"" is needed. (no validation of any kind is needed or submit or saving or anything)</p>

<p>The only code I've been able to get close is really really ugly, long, and convoluted. I can't help but think there is a very simple way to do it and just get the same function to apply to each grouping of inputs. It will look like below but probably much longer.</p>

<pre><code>some text
&lt;input id=""a"" type=""number"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input id=""b"" type=""number"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input id=""c"" type=""number"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

<p>I live in a place with horrible, substandard, screamingly bad electricity.  The voltage coming down the wires can dip as much as 30% below the advertised 220V, causing all of the voltage stabilizers to cycle hard, and sometimes (up to 5 times daily) the whole system shorts out and has to be reset at the source.</p>

<p>Obviously, I'm starting to lose components here and there, which, given the current trend, will be quite costly soon.</p>

<p>I'd like to put in a medium-scale upstream solution that levels the curve before it hits my poor stabilizers and power supplies but I'm not sure where to start.  Could someone elaborate on what could be the cause of these surges (are they surges?), and a medium scale solution?  </p>

"1400","How to determine when a user is leaving a webpage (excluding certain links)","<p><strong>The situation:</strong> I have a Grails webpage with two tables. One table displays a persons information (including certain flags), and the second table has a list of flags with an ""add button"" that allows the user to add a given flag to themselves.</p>

<p>Now, there is a save button that, when clicked, pushes the current ""state"" of the users flags to our database. So I want to be able to display a prompt if there is unsaved information being displayed when a user tries to navigate to another part of the site. This is easy enough by using an existing isDirty boolean that each flag stores. I can just loop through the persons active flags and check if it is dirty or not. If the person contains at least 1 dirty flag, I need to display a prompt if they try to leave, because that data won't be saved unless they explicitly hit the button.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> There are many ways to navigate away from this page. I am using
 <code>&lt;body onbeforeunload=""checkForDirtyFlags();""&gt;</code>, where checkForDirtyFlags() is a basic js function to check for any dirty flags. But here's the thing - when a user adds or removes a flag, that causes a page reload because the way the page is setup is to redirect to a url like this: </p>

<pre><code>""http://my.url/addFlag/123456""
</code></pre>

<p>The controller then knows to add the flag with id 123456 to the current person. This does NOT change where the person is in the website however, because the same page is still rendered (it just contains updated tables). So basically, when I see a URL with addFlag or removeFlag, I do not want to prompt the user if they are sure they want to navigate away from the page, because in the eyes of the user they are not leaving the page. </p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> Is there any way to determine what the target is during an <code>onbeforeunload</code>? So that I can have something like this in my javascript:</p>

<pre><code>function checkForDirtyFlag() {
    if( justAdding ) { //We are just adding a flag. No prompt necessary
        //Don't do anything
    }
    else if( justRemoving ) { //We are just removing a flag. No prompt necessary
        //Don't do anything
    }
    else { // In this case, we want to prompt them to save before leaving
        alert('You have unsaved data on the page. Leaving now will lose that data. Are you sure you want to leave?');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If any of this isn't clear, please let me know and I'll try and clear it up.</p>

"1405","CodeNarc's static code analysis is not able to find proper class dependencies","<p>When using CodeNarc for static code analysis on Groovy &amp; Grails code, it is not able to figure out class hierarchies. There is a private method in one service class say BaseService. Another service class say ChildService extends the BaseService class. One of the methods in the ChildService calls a private method defined in the BaseService. But the BaseService class  does not use the private method anywhere in its own class. So when analyzing the BaseService class in isolation, the private method will appear as unused. But when we look at the class hierarchy, we can understand one of its subclass is calling it.<br>
So, my question is, how does CodeNarc miss that kind of dependency? Doesn't static code analyzers build parse tree and analyze on it? If not how does it analyze code? Any insight into the internals of static code analysis is highly appreciated.<br>

"1408","Modeling a center of mass of a thin wire","<p>I am asked to find the moment about the $x$ axis for a thin wire of constant density.  This thin wire lies along the curve $y=\sqrt{x}$ and the limits for integration are $x=0$ and $x=2$.</p>

<p>I know from my textbook that the moment about the $x$ axis is: $M_y = \int \tilde{y} dm$</p>

<p>Because this is a thin wire, I know that I need to subdivide the wire into small segments for integration.  I have the following for relevant data for each segment:</p>

<p>Length: $dl = \sqrt{x}dx$</p>

<p>mass: $dm = \delta dl = \delta \sqrt{x}dx$</p>

<p>It's the part about the distance of the center of mass to the $x$ axis that I think I'm missing.  I have the following:</p>

<p>$\tilde{y} = \sqrt{x}$</p>

<p>Therefore, my final integral is:</p>

<p>$$
M_y = \int \tilde{y} dm = \int_0^2 \delta \sqrt{x} \sqrt{x} dx = \delta \int_0^2 x dx = \delta \left.\frac{1}{2}x^2\right|_0^2 = \delta 2

<p>This particular problem is an odd numbered problem and so I know that I've got it incorrect.  Please help me to see where I'm going wrong.</p>

"1412","Testing your databases via C# tests","<p>I've been assigned the task of testing our database. It's a test database and we can do anything we want to it and easily roll it back. I've been given this task because we're still in design phase'ish (meaning any changes at any point in time of the project can happen... renaming the Person.FirstName column to [First_Name] and later renaming it to [First Name]. My goals is to establish a rough estimate for what kind of pain we're walking in to when we make changes so we can plan for this ahead of time. We can also expect these kinds of changes during production too.</p>

<p>The items I have on my list are and have written tests for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Send in the word null (not a literal null but ""null"") because using dynamic SQL it can flip out thinking you really mean null. We found this out because someone with the last name ""null"" caused an exception to be thrown.</p></li>
<li><p>Using single quotes because dynamic SQL no likely single quotes. Again, someone with one in their name caused a crash.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Having never done this before, that's about all I know that can crash. Any other ideas out there? We're trying to emulate data a user may enter.</p>

<p>edit 1: Our problem is we have a search screen with roughly 25 fields they can search by. Some of these search fields are simple (e.g. first name) some are less simple (category 1 with a date less than 2 but also has category 2 with a date greater than 2 OR has category 4 at any period of time). The search screen allows for a user to select different oeprators and predicates with each of these 25 fields. Is there a better way to handle this than dynamic SQL? I'm in a position and a point in time where we can change to something different if it's better.</p>

<p>edit 2: I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but we use LINQ to access the stored procedures. My research has shown that dynamic LINQ won't do what we need it to do like a dynamic SQL query will. May be wrong though.</p>

"1427","UITableView with multiple NSFetchedResultsControllers causing Assertion failure","<p>I have a UITableView with 3 sections and each section is being fed through unique NSFetchedResultsController. </p>

<p>I am getting <strong>Assertion failure</strong> from the <strong>NSFetchedResultsController -controllerDidChangeContent</strong>, when inserting, updating...the table.</p>

<p>My guess is issue with indexPaths coming in method below as every controller has only single section (0) and for controller in section 0 the failure doesn't happen.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)controller:(NSFetchedResultsController*)controller didChangeObject:(id)anObject atIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)indexPath forChangeType:(NSFetchedResultsChangeType)type newIndexPath:(NSIndexPath*)newIndexPath

"1428","zsh random color in PS1","<p>My <code>.bashrc</code> <code>PS1</code> (abridged) is</p>

<pre><code>\u\[\e[01;3$(($RANDOM % 8))m\]@\h \w $'
</code></pre>

<p>With the way bash works, it interpolates the random color after each command so the <code>@</code> is a different color each time (at least in the 31-37 range).</p>

<p>However, I've been unable to do something similar in zsh.  The <code>$''</code> syntax does not allow for command substitution, and concatenating does not work either:</p>

<pre><code>$'\e[01;3'$(($RANDOM % 8))
# The \e[01;3 character is printed first, then the random number
</code></pre>

<p>Using quotes <code>""</code> does not work either; it just prints out a literal <code>\e...</code></p>

<p>I know that zsh also has some built in text colors like <code>%{$fg[red]%}</code> and I could somehow select a random color from the array, but the problem is that it needs to be randomly selected by the <code>PS1</code> and not simply on start up or the random choice will be made only once.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can interpolate a random number in the PS1 in zsh to achieve this?</p>

"1448","Opinion on combined strong/weak smart pointer","<p>I would like to get some constructive input on smart pointers.</p>

<p>The C++11 standard defines <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>weak_ptr</code> such that you can model data dependencies as DAGs with ""weak"" edges that do not cause dependency cycles.
Thus, the distinction between strong and weak pointers is modelled on the type level.</p>

<p>What about a smart pointer that decides ownership at runtime through a state flag.</p>

<p>We have a smart pointer in our library that does so and has the main advantage that you can point to objects either on the heap or on the stack.</p>

<pre><code>MyClass myObj;
my_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; ptr(&amp;myObj, Slave());
my_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; ptr2(new MyClass(), Master());
</code></pre>

<p>What other advantages and disadvantages do you see?
I have not been able to find such a smart pointer in any library so far, so: Are we the first to see the need for this feature or is it a dumb/dangerous idea?</p>

<p>Thanks for all your input!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Apparently, I have not made myself clear enough.
There can be only one master and an arbitrary number of slaves.
In this way, the scheme I propose differs from weak/strong pointers since it is much simpler.</p>

<p>The <code>my_ptr</code> class only stores a pointer and the state:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class my_ptr
{
    enum PtrState { MASTER, SLAVE } };

    T * ptr;
    PtrState state;

    my_ptr() : ptr(), state(MASTER) {}

<p>I'm familiar with grabbing xml, json, etc. but typically I haven't worked with many NVP type of APIs in terms of grabbing the query immediately from an response sent back from a resource server-side.  So <em>how is a query sent back, in the body of a response, header, what</em>?  How do you grab it, with the stream object just like you do anything else?</p>

<p>This questions relates to the environment I work in C# but really it relates to the web as a whole as well which is why I tagged this in multiple categories as a Request/Response is not MS specific however I am also at the same time trying to utilize the .NET WebClient object.</p>

I haven't found what seems like a best practice for this, so I wanted to ask if anyone has an approach that they think works really well.</p>

<p>As an example setup (this is made up but illustrates the problem), let's say we have a book, with chapters. Each book has a title and author, and a bunch of chapters. Each chapter has text. We want to index the book's fields and the chapters' text so you can search for a book by author, or for any book with certain words in it.</p>

<pre><code>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  include Tire::Model::Search
  include Tire::Model::Callbacks

  has_many :chapters

  mapping do
    indexes :title, :analyzer =&gt; 'snowball', :boost =&gt; 100
    indexes :author, :analyzer =&gt; 'snowball'
    indexes :chapters, type: 'object', properties: {
      chapter_text: { type: 'string', analyzer: 'snowball' }
    }
  end
end

class Chapter &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :book
end
</code></pre>

<p>So then I do the search with:</p>

<pre><code>s = Book.search do
  query { string query_string }
end
</code></pre>

<p>That doesn't work, even though it seems like that indexing should do it. If instead I index:</p>

<pre><code>indexes :chapters, :as =&gt; 'chapters.map{|c| c.chapter_text}.join('|'), :analyzer =&gt; 'snowball'
</code></pre>

<p>That makes the text searchable, but obviously it's not a nice hack and it loses the actual associated object. I've tried variations of the searching, like:</p>

<pre><code>s = Book.search do
  query do
    boolean do
      should { string query_string }
      should { string ""chapters.chapter_text:#{query_string}"" }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With no luck there, either. If anyone has a good, clear example of indexing and searching associated ActiveRecord objects using Tire, it seems like that would be a really good addition to the knowledge base here.</p>

<p>Consider the following variant of the contractibility problem.  Each node in the input graph is labeled with a unique bit-string of arbitrary length.  The similarity of two nodes is defined to be the length of the longest common prefix of their labels; the weight of an edge is the similarity between its endpoints.  At each step, we are allowed contract any <em>maximum</em>-weight edge $(u,v)$ and label the new node with the longest common prefix of the labels of $u$ and $v$.  (There may be several maximum-weight edges.)  However, we must also preserve label uniqueness; if some other node already has the new label, we cannot contract the edge $(u,v)$.  Our goal is to <em>minimize</em> the total length of the node labels.</p>

<p><strong>Are the following problems NP-hard?</strong></p>

"1474","Rails and big sql queries too slow","<p>In my rails app DB (Postgresql), I have a big table with about 10 million rows. What I'm trying to do is get a subset of this table through certain conditions, which gets me a dataset of about 1 or 2 million rows, and then group + count this by one of the attributes (which takes a few thousand different values).</p>

<p>It actually works. Problem : it is way too slow. Like between 10 and 100 seconds to render the results depending on the size of the subset dataset.</p>

<p>What are my options here ? The ones I'm thinking about : </p>

<ol>
<li>I'm an idiot and it shouldn't take so long. Maybe there are ways to run such a query much faster. If so, I'm all ears for ideas.  </li>
<li>I should run these processes separately, maybe in the background, and store the results in another table that I could call later ... a bit like caching</li>
<li>I can keep things like this but render the results progressively in the view or set up a good looking ""progress bar""</li>
<li>Use specific tools for big data queries..</li>

"1476","Capture screenshot of Active Window","<p>I've created a small application that allows the user to capture the screenshot and save the image at a user defined location. It also allows the user to capture the screenshot of the active window as well.</p>

<p>The issue is with the active window. I have learnt that Java does not provide a method to get the screenshot of the active window. So, I googled and found that developers have been using the Alt+PrntScrn to get the screenshot and get the image from the clipboard.</p>

<p>The code is the following one:</p>

<pre><code>     robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_ALT);
     robot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN);
     robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_PRINTSCREEN);
     robot.keyRelease(KeyEvent.VK_ALT);
     Thread.sleep(1500);
     RenderedImage image = (RenderedImage)getClipboard();
     saveToImage(image,targetLocation);
</code></pre>

<p>Now what happens is that when the Alt key is pressed by the robot class, the focus goes on the toolbar of the application of which the user wants to get the screenshot and the screenshot is taken of the toolbar and not that of the window that the user has focus on.</p>

<p>Please advise on how to solve this problem.</p>

  <p>Q: How do I make the option/alt key act like Meta or send escape codes?<br>
  A: Go to Preferences → Bookmark tab. Select your bookmark on the left, and then open the Keyboard tab. At the bottom is a set of buttons that lets you select the behavior of the Option key. For many users esc+ will be the best choice.</p>
</blockquote>

In essence this looks a lot like the factory method with parameters demonstrated in the book <em>Design Patterns</em>. Is there a better way to do this?

"1485","Looking for a canonical example of this overflow problem","<p>This came up in an interview recently (the concept) and I was discussing it with a friend today.  Here's the idea:</p>

<p>Suppose you are calculating the dot product of a three-dimensional vector.  Simple function would be ""return (x1*x2)+(y1*y2)+(z1*z2)"".</p>

<p>However, if the first and second term are large positive numbers, they could overflow even if they answer is within the acceptable range.  For example, let's say the integer limit is 128.  100 + 100 - 80 = 120, but if you do the first two additions first you'll overflow.</p>

<p>In a university class this came up on a C assignment where we were calculating something that we'd probably done a thousand times before but had never paid attention to overflow (this was the part when we were learning about writing sanitary code), like taking an average or something of the sort.</p>

<p>Anyone have any idea in what context this could have happened?  I know it was some situation where you had to use comparisons either before or instead of addition/subtraction to avoid this overflow</p>

"1496","ASP.NET MVC - How should sending email be handled?","<p>In an ASP.NET MVC application, how should the sending of emails be handled? I've been thinking about this, and I really like the idea of handling it in an MVC-oriented way (it is an MVC application, after all.)</p>

<p>What I mean is that the email that gets delivered to the user is really just a view that should have a model passed to it. This raises some questions: How should we deliver views to both the requesting browser and an SMTP server at the same time, when an action is executed? Does the framework have any facilities to support this? If not, is there some 3rd party release/guidance for this sort of functionality?</p>

<p>The alternatives to treating email sending in an MVC way are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Email sending code shows up in the controller's action methods.</li>
<li>Email sending is a behavior of the Model objects.</li>
</ul>

"1501","Can i nest classes within enums, and create arraylist within an enum?","<p>I'm trying to do this. I have an <code>enum</code> of week days. I have used <code>enum</code> since weekdays are constant</p>

<pre><code>public enum WeekDay {
  MONDAY,TUESDAY,WEDNESDAY,THURSDAY,FRIDAY;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I have a class, called <code>Session</code>. A session is simply what is going on at a particular time e.g. a maths class</p>

<pre><code>public class Session {
  // some fields
  public String title; 
  public int duration,start,end;

  /** several methods follow to get and set, and check e.t.c **/
}
</code></pre>

<p>There is a third class, called <code>Venue</code>. Venues host the sessions, e.g. the maths class can be from 9am to 10am, at a venue called ""maths-class"" (an example)</p>

<pre><code>public class Venue { // simply a place that can hold several sessions in a day
  private String name;
  private int capacity;

  /** several methods**/
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I need to do is this - create a list of sessions in the enum i.e. each day has its sessions, and then I need to hold the enums in a structure (an ArrayList or enumset?) within a venue i.e. a venue has sessions from Monday to Friday (ideally school classes). So it will be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public enum WeekDay {
  MONDAY,TUESDAY,WEDNESDAY,THURSDAY,FRIDAY;

  /** the list of sessions for a given day**/
  private ArrayList &lt;Session&gt; list;
  private int numOfSessions; // number of sessions

  /** with some methods like **/
  addSession();
  removeSession();
  getSession();
  checkTimeOfSession();
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that in the venue, we can have:</p>

<pre><code>public class Venue {
  private String name;
  private int capacity;
  private ? &lt;WeekDay&gt; list; //structure to hold days, i don't know which one to use yet

  /** several methods like **/
  numOfSessionsOn();
  getSessionsOn();
  addSessionOn();
  removeSessionOn();
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can I nest the <code>Session</code> class within an <code>enum</code>?</li>
<li>Can an <code>enum</code> accept <code>arraylists</code>?</li>
<li>What is the best structure to hold the enums with their sessions inside the venue?</li>
<li>Any better ideas for this? </li>
</ol>

<p>Someone just told me that I'll be passing the same day to all venues regardless e.g. MONDAY is MONDAY for all venues, its list will be updated by every venue. So I think that's the end of discussion even though nobody commented.</p>

<li>some 3rd party components</li>
<li>.vdproj files (setup projects inside VS 2005) for .msi building - not ""one click deployment""</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Problem</em></p>

<p>I am in a project phase where there are several updates to the project during a day.  Since every change is small (two assemblies at most), it would be convenient for the user to use some kind of automatic update that will be both fast and worry-free.</p>

<p><em>Proposition</em></p>

<p>I would like to do a simple system that would store my app files somewhere on my server, along with some xml file that will list them with their hashes.  Desktop app will read xml, compare hashes, download the required files, restart the app and user would have new version without even noticing it.</p>

<p>So my thought go further...</p>

<p>Client app for it: simple, day or two of work.  Considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>have to take care of permissions to write files to user program directory (actually I'm helpless if I can't)</li>
<li>have to launch updater process that will download and replace files and relaunch original app</li>
<li>have to make local xml file with hashes at first run, and for that I need local list of deployed files that could change (since all of them aren't just in the local app folder)</li>
</ul>

<p>Server side is trivial, but there are also some considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>root file with current version description, file list and hashes</li>
<li>manually upload files to server, create tool for hashing files</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the question: <strong>is there some tool that follows my train of thought to do that without much hassle from the side?</strong></p>

<p>I want to publish some jar files to a local Ivy repository using Ant. The Ant script creates four jar files:</p>

<ul>
<li>sed-ws-client.jar</li>
<li>sed-ws-client-src.jar</li>
<li>sed-enums.jar</li>
<li>sed-enums-src.jar</li>
</ul>

<p>These jars should end up in two different directories in the Ivy repository (e.g. a <code>sed-ws-client</code> directory and a <code>sed-enums</code> directory). The repository currently contains 0.0.1 and 0.0.2 versions of these jars in the appropriate directories, with corresponding ivy-[version].xml files (this was done manually).</p>

<p>I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to construct the ""publish"" Ant target and the project's <code>ivy.xml</code> file. I'm forced to put a module name in the <code>info</code> tag of the <code>ivy.xml</code> file, but this would imply that I can only publish jars to one directory in the Ivy repository?</p>

<p>I've tried various things but the Ant build always fails. I just want a simple explanation of the steps I need to take to get it working. The repository structure can be changed if necessary.</p>

If I run the tests package by package, everything works fine and all my tests pass. However, if I try to run them all at once, eventually (about 360 tests in), Android starts spitting out <code>!!! Failed Binder Transaction Errors !!!</code>. After about 10-20 of these errors, the process for the application I am testing gets killed and the unit tests never even complete. </p>

<p>I should note that during this time Eclipse reports <code>Collecting test information</code> in the Console. I think that is odd because it shows that it is running tests even though the JUnit UI doesn't reflect that. When everything works properly, during the <code>Collecting test information</code> phase I see the tests run, the JUnit UI then comes up, and then all the tests are run again (I know this by reading logcat). That is (I think) a separate issue, but I felt I would mention it if anybody knew what that was about. </p>

<p>As per Christopher's answer below, I have verified that this only happens when attempting to run this through Eclipse. If i run my test suite using ANT, all the tests finally execute. </p>

<p>When I attempt to run my test suite now, Eclipse essentially hangs on ""collecting test information"". I haven't let it run for an extended period of time, but I will give that a try as soon as I can to see if it ever completes. </p>

<p>I am not interested in selecting the first object (so I would use ray/triangle intersections), i want to select the closest edge/corner to the mouse click position.</p>

<p>Obviously, that will only work if I make debits negative. Is there an elegant solution here, to perhaps filter the set into credits and debits, sum those, and perform a difference? Will that maintain accuracy? I've looked into NSPredicate, but I'm not sure how exactly to proceed.</p>

<p>Is there a way to extract a specific part (sprite) of the spritesheet's xml to put into the HTML markup, based on a class (or something else)? My only thought is to manually break up the spritesheet, put each sprite path-string into an array/object, and use js (maybe Raphael) to write the inline markup and set up the hover colors; but I'm not sure what kind of overhead that would add, or if it's a really convoluted way of doing something that shouldn't be.</p>

$$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}d^{3}kf(K)e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}=\frac{4\pi}{R}\int_{0}^{\infty}dK\, K\, f(K)\,\sin(KR)$$

<p>Can you help me to understand why this is true? Maybe proving the formula or telling me a book where I can find the proof. Thanks.</p>

From what I can tell it is adding the meta information correctly because when I edit a post that has a custom name/ID it shows up in the input box by default as it should.</p>

<p>So my issue is that I am trying to pull the custom ID/name and use it as an additional ID tag in the code. Although it is not retrieving anything. When I use the code in my theme and check the html on the page the ID is showing ID="""". So for some reason it is not pulling anything. Can anyone see an issue?</p>

<p>If I change get_the_ID() to the_ID() then it returns a value but it is the post ID instead of the custom id the user entered into the feild.</p>

<p>that means when customer typing in textbox, the input chars will be sent to server, and the candidate list will be returned from server immediately.</p>

<p>In order to short the response time as possible as we can, someone suggest we could take one ajax only on this function.</p>

<p>But my question are:</p>

<p>1) Is it possible by one ajax request, (if it can be ""keep-alive""), then we can send the input chars, get the response, then send new inputs chars, get the new response again? seems like a websocket a little.</p>

<p>Since I cannot figure out how to send input chars(commands) again and again on client side by javascript.</p>

<p>seems no API to send multiple commands/requests on one ajax object.</p>

<p>2) If we can send multiple commands on one ajax object, how can we get multiple responses one by one from this ajax object?</p>

I can pull up the taskman and start explorer.exe manually.  I have another Terminal Server setup exactly the same way (same apps, settings, GPO, etc . . .)  the only difference is we deployed Symantec Endpoint Client 11.0.5 on Friday.  For some reason the working Terminal Server is still on 11.0.4, but the suspect server received the 11.0.5 client upgrade.</p>

<p>I checked the eventviewer for any relevant explorer.exe entries to no avail.  It seems that if SEP is preventing explorer.exe from starting at login it would do the same for the domain admin starting explorer.exe from the taskman.  I disabled the SEP client and services on the server and issued smc -stop and tried logging in again.  Still no explorer.exe. So I'm not sure if the client upgrade is relevant but it is worth mentioning since that was the last system change.</p>

"1596","Enable/Disable HTML Element (IFrame) to Prevent or Allow Tabbing to it / Focusing it","<p>Is there an easy way to enable or disable an IFrame to take it out of the Tab order?
<br /><br /><br /><br />
I’ve created a simple HTML page that has several links that when clicked show or hide an IFrame associated with the link and set the SRC property of the IFrame to one of my Wordpress blogs’ PressThis forms. This way I can easily add a post to any of the blogs from a single page.</p>

<p>Everything on this page works nicely as expected except for the behavior of the Tab key. All of the IFrames are initially hidden and have no SRC set (eg <code>&lt;iframe src=""""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code>). The problem is that when I press Tab, instead of going from link to link, it sets focus to the hidden (and empty) IFrames between links.</p>

<p>When the frame is shown and loaded with the PressThis form, pressing Tab correctly navigates through the input fields of the form (and everything else in the page) between links. However when the frame is then hidden again, pressing Tab still goes through each field, so getting from link to link with the keyboard is pretty bad.</p>

<p>I’m trying to figure out a way to toggle the IFrame so that when it is hidden, pressing Tab skips over it (it is removed from the Tab order), and when it is shown, pressing Tab navigates between its form fields.</p>

<p>I looked around and cannot find anything about disabling HTML elements directly (HTML elements don’t seem to have a disabled property as part of the DOM, nor is there a disabled CSS style). The closest thing I could find was people asking about disabling specific form fields.</p>

<p>However, I think, these instructions back to old ages where there were severe hardware limitation for memory. Closing a dictionary to free memory. The memory a PS script needs were probably comparable with the machine available memory. In modern time, the memory needed for a heavy <code>PostScript</code> task (e.g. long document or complicated drawing) is much lesser than the machine memory, and closing a dictionary with hundreds or even thousands of elements should have no significant effect on the machine performance.</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong! Consider that we put everything in one dictionary or global dictionary; does it have a negative impact on the PostScript performance?</p>

"1616","Adding sections to a plist for Xcode for use in Cocoa touch Table View","<p>I am a beginning iPhone SDK programmer.  I built a simple practice application I am trying to use to learn more about table views.  It's an app that loads football teams from a plist and displays them in a table view with their stadium name and logo.  Tapping the team goes to a detail view for that team.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand how to add sections to this, so that I might have a couple of teams in one section and others in another section, etc.</p>

<p>I would assume I need to both re-structure my plist and change the code to read arrays from the different levels of the plist?</p>

<p>To begin, I had a plist with the root array consisting of 3 dictionaries, one for each team.  Each dictionary had 3 keys, ""name"" ""stadium"" and ""logo"".  This works fine.  I am loading it via:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""teams"" ofType:@""plist""];
teams = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:path];
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>// Configure the cell.
NSDictionary *team = [teams objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
cell.textLabel.text = [team objectForKey:@""name""];
NSString *imgPath = [team valueForKey:@""logo""]; 
cell.imageView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:imgPath];
cell.detailTextLabel.text =[team objectForKey:@""stadium""];
return cell;
</code></pre>

<p>No problem.  But now I wanted the sections, so I changed my plist to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;array&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;teams 1&lt;/key&gt;

"1617","FQL to search newsfeed","<p>I am having a strange issue with an app that I am developing. I am using PHP SDK to call the Graph API on server side and here is my code that calls the API:</p>

<pre><code>$params = array('q' =&gt; 'George', 'limit' =&gt; 100);

$newsfeed = $facebook-&gt;api('/me/home', 'GET', $params);
</code></pre>

<p>And next is the code to render HTML of the newsfeed. I have a footer below that once clicked, loads further posts. But what I have observed is that in case of searching the newsfeed by providing additional 'q' parameter, we do not get results beyond one week.</p>

<p>Now I am giving a second try to FQL instead of Graph API. Good thing with Graph API was that appending a q parameter to /me/home would do the searching for you automatically and you had nothing to do. But with FQL, this does not seems to be the case as per the following documentation suggests:</p>

<p><a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/stream/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/stream/</a></p>

<p>My idea is to use following FQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT post_id, actor_id, target_id, message, comments, likes FROM stream WHERE filter_key in (SELECT filter_key FROM stream_filter WHERE uid = me() AND type = 'newsfeed') AND strpos(message, 'facebook') &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas how the search can be implemented? I actually want to emulate the news feed within the application so please enlighten me about batching multiple FQL queries if you have any ideas on that.</p>

"1618","Getting HttpContext from BackgroundWorker process","<p>I have an ASP.NET site and I've been doing some work refactoring code to try to remove some long running processes (in the order of an hour) from the actual http Request by creating a BackgroundWorker and sending the work off to that to process. This was running fine on cutdown tests but when I applied the logic to the real code I found problems accessing Session variables from the code running in the Background Worker. It seems that the HttpContext object that was passed has a null session and if I ask for HttpContext.Current I get null back.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that this is because they are in a different thread and that the session and HttpContext.Current are both reliant on being in the same thread. Is there any way I can get access to the Session from the background worker or am I stuck with finding all the variables I need from session and putting them in an usable data structure and then putting them back in session (if appropriate) afterwards? It obviously complicates the refactor massively if I need to do this so I'd rather not.</p>

<p>Thanks for any thoughts you might have. I'm open to other suggestions on how I might do this other than BackgroundWorker processes (which were suggested to me in another question).</p>

<p><code>MyHeader.h file</code></p>

<p><code>Header2.h file</code></p>

<pre><code>   typedef enum{
    hello, hi, bye
    }MyEnum;
</code></pre>

<p>So, I have tried using /FORCE:MULTIPLE, but it's not working.
I can not change the enum names also, because they are getting used in many places in both the projects.</p>

Instead of moving the <code>enum</code> to other file, are there any other solution?

<p>But what if your ""other module"" that calls into this code wasn't using C++11 threads, but something like Qt's <code>QThread</code>.  Is atomic initialization of statics then outside of the scope of C++11's ability to make such a guarantee?

def raise_window(widget, w2):

w1 = Gtk.Window()

<p>When I click the button in the PyGObject version, the other window isn't raised, and I get this error:</p>

Without splitting the class in two, I have found a simple pattern that solves this:</p>

<pre><code>package foo;
import bar.MisteriousX;

public class U {
    static private boolean isXPresent = false;
    static {
        try {

        } catch (Exception e) {
            // loading of a sample X class failed: no X for you

        if (isXPresent) {
            new Runnable() {
                public void run() { 
                    System.err.println(""X says "" + MisteriousX.say());

<p>With this pattern, U requires X present to compile, but works as expected when run with or without X present. Unless all accesses to the X library are inside internal classes, this code launches a classloader exception.</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount -t cifs //Windows_PC/Shares /mnt/Windows -o user=username
                   ^----Here---^
</code></pre>

<p>how can i get the name of the computer from which i am getting the shared folder.
I was thinking even if i can get the ip address i can use it in place of the name.</p>

<p>So unless someone has a better suggestion here is what i need:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can i get the ip address of the computer from the shared drive</li>
<li>How can i mount it directly on ubuntu.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The shared drive is not on my machine but on a different machine on the network. i don't know the name of the computer nor the ip address</p>

<p>We currently run 6 Windows servers (4x Win2008, 2x Win2000) with TS access for our users. This runs over a cable modem connection. We also have an ADSL connection which we want to use as a failover should the cable connection go down. </p>

<p>My question is this: Can the 2801 we have be used to do what I require? If so, would it be difficult to set up, and are there any known complications with this kind of failover?
If not, can anybody suggest an alternative?</p>

<p>Say I have a target string <code>elephant</code>. The match I would want to pull is <code>elephant mouse</code>, for example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?

$target = ""elephant"";

$data = array(
  'elephant mouse',
  'rhinoceros',
  'alligator',
  'hippopotamus',
  'rat',
);

foreach ( $data as $datum ) {
  echo ""$target &gt;&gt; $datum == "" .  levenshtein($target, $datum) . ""\n"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I get the result</p>

<pre><code>elephant &gt;&gt; elephant mouse == 6
elephant &gt;&gt; rhinoceros == 10
elephant &gt;&gt; alligator == 7
elephant &gt;&gt; hippopotamus == 10
elephant &gt;&gt; rat == 7
</code></pre>

<p>So while <code>rhino</code> and <code>hippo</code> are at 10, in my actual data set, I couldn't really tell the difference between <code>elephant mouse</code>, <code>rat</code> and <code>alligator</code>, which are neck-and-neck at 6 and 7. This is bogus data, but in my data set, words that are closer in length only get a much lower score than words that are <code>target + extra</code>. </p>

<p>How should I configure the options of <code>levenshtein()</code>? I can set new integer values for the cost of insertion, replacement, and deletion. What weighting will give me what I want?</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the reason(s) for this performance difference?</li>
<li>Is this performance indicative of some best practice in javascript?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks in advance guys.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the responses - as some have mentioned, further testing on my part seems to suggest that this issue is browser (or rather, Javascript compiler specific). I've tested additionally in Safari, IE 10 and Firefox. IE 10 and Firefox both gave results so close as to be no different. Safari executed the operations on Object2 slightly faster than those on Object1 (around 2% on average). I would like to know what the outlier (Other) is though, as the performance difference in that case appears to be substantial.</p>

"1670","Slow WPF performance on GMA 500 integrated graphics","<p>My team is developing WPF applications to be deployed on an Intel Atom Z530 netbook hardware platform.  The Intel Atom Z530 comes with Intel GMA 500 integrated graphics, which has a PowerVR SGX 535 GPU core.  The PowerVR SGX 535 GPU core is the exact graphics core used in Apple's A4 chip set for the iPad.</p>

<p>My question:
Why is WPF so slow with PowerVR SGX 535 graphics?</p>

<p>We actually turn hardware acceleration off for our WPF application to get better performance (screen to screen transitions, dialog transitions, 2D graphics interaction).  The iPad technology stack is able to achieve much better UI performance with the same hardware graphics core.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One is related to an example showing that the s-invariant of an ample line bundle on a projective variety X is an algebraic integer of degree $\leq dim X$. Recall that, given an ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}\subset \mathcal{O}_X$ on a projective irreducible variety X, the s-invariant of $\mathcal{I}$ with respect to an ample line bundle L is $s_L(\mathcal{I})$ is the minimum $s\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mu^{\ast}(sL)-E$ is nef on $X'$, where $$\mu:X'=Bl_{\mathcal{I}}X\rightarrow X$$ is the blow-up along the ideal $\mathcal{I}$, with exceptional divisor E. The author claims that the class $s_L(\mathcal{I})L-E$ is nef (by definition) but not ample and then uses the Campana-Peternell theorem to conclude the result. How does the non-ampleness follow?</p></li>
<li><p>Now let L be a big and nef divisor on a smooth projective variety X of dimension n and assume that the Seshadri constant of L at some point $x\in X$ is $\epsilon(L;x)&gt;2n$ (we hence have the same inequality at a very general point). Take two general points $x,y\in X$ and consider the blow-up $\mu:X'=Bl_{\{s,y\}}X\rightarrow X$, with corresponding exceptional divisors $E_x$ and $E_y$. The divisor $\mu^{\ast}(\frac{1}{2}L)-nE_x$ is then nef (by definition) and big. How does bigness follow?</p></li>

I have an Apache server running on port 8000 (confirmed in <code>ports.conf</code> and by <code>nmap</code>) yet any request to it is automatically redirected to port 80 (specifically, the port is dropped so 80 is default); the request is then refused.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checked Apache configurations</li>
<li>Disabled <code>mod_rewrite</code></li>
<li>Checked iptables (and disabled to be sure)</li>

Currently I have a big make file that downloads, unpacks, compiles and installs all dependencies. This however is a little tedious, since there are quite a few dependencies and the make file is getting larger and larger which eventually will be hard to maintain. Therefore I am looking for a packaging tool with the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should be a light weight package manager which is very easy to install (or even installs itself and afterwards all my dependencies)</li>
<li>The destination of the installed binaries, libraries etc. should be customizable</li>
<li>Each installation process of a dependency should be easy configurable </li>
<li>It should be possible to include self written scripts that get executed at a specific point during the installation process (in order to manipulate make files, flags etc)</li>
<li>No admin rights should be necessary since all clients that install my application will not have admin rights and are not able to use an already installed package manager</li>

<ol>

<li>Content nav</li>
<li>Login name</li>
<li>Leaderboard</li>
</ol>

<p>Excluding the content section (as this changes depending on the link on the left nav and content nav used as a kinda sub-menu). All the other sections remain roughly the same</p>

<p>I thought about doing:</p>

<pre><code>Class User_Profile extends Controller
{

    function index()
    {
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Left_Nav');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Content_Nav');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Login_Name');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Leaderboard', 'Board');

        $this-&gt;Left_Nav-&gt;index(array('highlight_selected_page' =&gt; 'blah'));

        $this-&gt;load('User');

        $content_data = $this-&gt;User-&gt;get_profile_details();

        $this-&gt;view-&gt;load('content', $content_data);

        $this-&gt;Login_Name-&gt;index();
        $this-&gt;Board-&gt;index();
    }

}

<p>Obviously this <code>load_controller</code> does not exist but this functionaility would be useful. The controller for each section gets the data required from the model and then loads the page through <code>$this-&gt;view-&gt;load()</code></p>

<p>It could be a headache to have this code in all the left nav links like News, Users, About Us, etc.. But then again not every nav link has all those sections so I need that flexability of having the sections as a ""partial view""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>public ByteBuffer put(byte[] src, int offset, int length)  </p>
  
  <p>Relative bulk put method  (optional
  operation).     This method transfers
  bytes into this buffer from the given
  source array.    If there are more
  bytes to be copied from the array than
  remain in this buffer, that is,    if
  length > remaining(), then no bytes
  are transferred and a
  BufferOverflowException is    thrown. 
  Otherwise, this method copies length
  bytes from the given array into this
  buffer,    starting at the given
  offset in the array and at the current
  position of this buffer.    The
  position of this buffer is then
  incremented by length.  In other
  words, an invocation of this method of
  the form <code>dst.put(src, off, len)</code> has
  exactly the same effect as the loop </p>

<pre><code> for (int i = off; i &lt; off + len; i++)
     dst.put(a[i]);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>except that it first checks that there is
  sufficient space in this buffer and it
  is potentially much more efficient.</p>
  
  <p>Parameters:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>src - The array from
  which bytes are to be read</li>
  <li>offset -
  The offset within the array of the
  first byte to be read; must be
  non-negative and no larger than
  array.length</li>
  <li>length - The number of
  bytes to be read from the given array;
  must be non-negative and no larger
  than array.length - offset</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Returns: This buffer</p>
  
  <p>Throws:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>BufferOverflowException - If there is
  insufficient space in this buffer </li>
  <li>IndexOutOfBoundsException - If the
  preconditions on the offset and length
  parameters do not hold </li>
  <li>ReadOnlyBufferException - If this
  buffer is read-only</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm a little concerned with the statements:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Otherwise, this method copies length
  bytes from the given array into this
  buffer,    starting at the given
  offset in the array and at the current
  position of this buffer.    The
  position of this buffer is then
  incremented by length.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and then:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>except that it first checks that there
  is sufficient space in this buffer and
  it is    potentially much more
  efficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>// <strong>* my additional comments *</strong> //  </p>

<p>Now I want to completely ""fill"" the 192 byte buffer (index therefore ranges from 0 - 191)<br>
So IF as is put forth in the doc, the buffer is ""incremented"" by the length<br>
 (192 bytes in this case)  </p>

<p>then it appears to me by implication the ""logic"" is going to add 192 bytes to index and<br>
 low and behold ... we're out of bounds on the index ...  </p>

<p>I'd really appreciate anyone's opinion on this.<br>
 Waiting for your comments and/or suggestions...  </p>

<p>Thanks  </p>

That is to say, if I remove the <code>,""LastModified"":""\/Date(-62135596800000+0000)\/""</code> from the json data then the call succeed. Add it back in and it fails.</p>

"1731","Keystroke to open a new window in Windows 7 Explorer?","<p>I'm a bit late to the Windows 7 party, and having just installed it yesterday, I'm already sorely missing an XP feature. In explorer, I used to be able to click the toolbar Up button with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> held down to open a new explorer window. In Windows 7, I neither have an Up button nor a keystroke to change navigation to open a new window (aside from <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+double click). </p>

<p>I'm not asking about the ""open everything in a new window"" option in Tools -> Folder Options. Most of the time I want to stay in the same window - but sometimes I don't.</p>

<p>I also know <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd> will go up a level, but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd> doesn't do anything. </p>

<p>So, two questions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a convenient way to open the parent folder in a new window</li>
<li>Does someone have a link to a good reference on all Windows 7 keyboard short cuts? </li>

"1736","Why can I not call these JQuery/Javascript Functions in an external script file?","<p>I am writing a lot of JQuery code in a page and have decided to move some of the functions out to a separate file.  So, file #1 has nothing but function definitions:</p>

<pre><code>function doSomething() { ... } 

function doSomethingElse() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>In the main page, I have placed my JQuery at the end of the file - following the optimization techniques found in Zakas' book ""High Performance Javascript"".</p>

<p>So, at the very end of the file (but before the closing body tag) I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/scripts/MyFunctions.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    doSomething();
    doSomethingElse();
 ....
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the final Javascript scripts are loaded - and run - after the page is loaded and the DOM declared.  However, I get an error every time that says <strong>'doSomething' is undefined.</strong></p>

<p>This works without problem if the functions are included in the main script.  It is only when I pull them outside that I get this error.  Now, my guess is that the first file hasn't being fully loaded/compiled when the second one makes its calls.  But it seems to me that the last script (essentially acting in the ""Ready"" role) should be the one compiled last.  When I look at JQuery and other JS files, they start with anonymous functions rather than just launching right in to function definitions so clearly there is something else going on.</p>

<p>Note that I don't <em>think</em> it is a problem loading/finding the file: I've tried various paths to ensure that the path is correct and that hasn't fixed the issue.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a clue why my functions aren't being found?</p>

<p>Update: If I take the file contents exactly as they are found and put it into the first script tag rather than loading it from the file, this works fine.  But I have checked the script file name repeatedly and it is correct.  So it is something about the process of loading it from an external file.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Solved.  I ran it through FireBug as keegan and dskrepps suggested and it jumped right out at me.  I had an ASP.NET variable that I was placing in the scripts but, of course, ASP.NET isn't parsing the file or replacing variables.  When Javascript saw these replaceable values, it was dying on a parse error that wasn't reported.  So - the file was NOT being loaded and it isn't a Javascript function call issue at all.  Instead, it was an error between the keyboard and the seat. ;-)</p>

<p>I seem to recall that Plasma displays have to stay in a certain vertical/horizontal arrangement; and that there are some LCDs that readily switch back and forth between landscape and portrait; but I don't know if rolling my own portrait mode is going to cause me to bust my monitor.</p>

<p>This displays the Germany's medals in every event. I want to retrieve the data as an array or something and display them in a table. The first thing I should do is open firebug and search for a json link to parse the data. The only time I have retrieved data from a website was by using twitter's or facebook's json data to show the followers and likes.</p>

"1752","How fast is SQLite via Python","<p>I was just curious if anyone could tell me if using SQLite to store a dictionary (as in brute force) for use in a Python script was an efficient method.  While I am relatively new to Python I do have quite a bit of experience with other programming languages and am currently working on a pentesting tool to use in Backtrack.  So far I am quite impressed with the speed and simplicity of Python, and my SQL queries seem to be working pretty ideally to return the needed prefixes for my brute force tool.  However, I guess what I'm wondering is what is the standard for storing large data files in Python?  Am I overlooking a better (faster) way of storing my prefixes simply because of my comfort with SQL?  Please bear in mind that I am not using Python to query IDs 0 through n and use them, rather I am using Python to narrow down the possibilities and query those dictionary entries that match the criteria.  Any help or opinions would be much appreciated!</p>

"1753","WCF: callback contract no async, error because no implement Begin/End methods","<p>I have a duplex WCF service. In the service contract, I have 3 async methods and 1 normal method (close session). In tha callback contract I only have 1 void method that is not async.</p>

<p>When I generate the proxy with svcUtil I use the /a paramter, and get the .cs. If I open the this file, I can see that is generated the Begin/end method for the no async method of the contract, I don't know well why, because this methods is not marked as async in the contract. Anyway, this is no the problem.</p>

<p>The problem is with the method of the callback contract. In my client application, I implement the callback interface, but I have implemented one method, an sync method, so I have not the Begin/End methods. However, I can't compile because I have an error, that the class that implement the callback interface does not implement the Begin/end methods.</p>

"1755","How to force a multihopping topology with xbee zb?","<p>I use some xbee (s2) modules with zb stack for mesh networking evaluation. Therefore a multi hopping environment has to be created. The problem is, that the firmware handles the association for themselves and there is no way deeper into the stack as the api provides. To force the path of the data, without to disturb the routing mechanism, I have tried to measure, I had to put them outside their reach. To get only the next hop in association isn't that easy. I used the least power level of the output, but the distance for the test setup is to large and the rf characteristics of the environment change undetermined.</p>

"1776","no member function declared in class","<p>I'm dealing with a very weird issue that I've never encountered before. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>//ISerialData.h
class ISerialData

    //snipped
    virtual unsigned int getDataSize()=0;
    //snipped
};

//CSerialData.h

private:

    unsigned int getDataSize();
    //snipped
};

//CSerialData.cpp
unsigned int CSerialData::getDataSize()
{
return dataStream.str().length();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compiling it gives the error:</p>

<pre><code>CSerialData.cpp:80: error: no ‘unsigned int CSerialData::getDataSize()’ member function declared in class ‘CSerialData’
</code></pre>

<p>Doing some trouble shooting, I removed the implementation from CSerialData.cpp to see what would happen. To my surprise, it compiled and linked successfully.</p>

<p>To test, I made the following statements in main.cpp:</p>

<pre><code>//main.cpp
ISerialData* sd = new CSerialData();
int w = sd-&gt;getDataSize();
std::cout&lt;&lt;""W: ""&lt;&lt;w&lt;&lt;""\n"";
</code></pre>

<p>Which outputted the following:</p>

<pre><code>W: -1543571782
</code></pre>

<p>If the program had the implementation, it would be zero, but I get garbage. I was expecting it to crash with a pure virtual call at least, much less link properly.</p>

<p>What could possibly cause it to:
1. Link at all
2. Run a function that doesn't have a definition
3. Not catch a pure virtual function call.
4. Not crash in any way</p>

<p>There must be <em>something</em> that it's calling, but I can't figure out how to troubleshoot this further.</p>

<p>This was compiled under Debian Squeeze 6.0.4 with:
g++ 4.4.5 (Debian 4.4.5-8)
ld version: GNU ld (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.20.1-system.20100303</p>

<p>Any insight is most appreciated, this function is one of three that I just added to the class, all of them show the same problems.</p>

"1779","Is it possible to get a custom ItemRenderer to scroll the DataGrid rather than its cell?","<p>I'm having an issue with a custom ItemRenderer I've written for a DataGrid. With this ItemRenderer, it's possible that the contents could exceed the width and height of the DataGrid cell - and when this happens, scroll bars appear, letting me scroll the individual cell.</p>

<p>What I would like, however, is that when the contents of the cell are too large, the entire DataGrid scrolls, rather than the individual cells.</p>

<p>Now, when I set the custom ItemRenderer's horizontal and vertical scroll bar policies to ""off"", I get the vertical scrolling on the DataGrid that I want (the individual cells stretch to accommodate the full height of the contents) but I don't get any horizontal scrolling. Instead, any content too wide for the cell is clipped. Incidentally, setting the DataGrid's horizontal scroll bar policy to ""on"" has no effect, the scroll bar gutter is drawn, but nothing scrolls</p>

<p>Is there a way to force the DataGrid to scroll horizontally when my custom ItemRenderer's contents are too wide for the cell?</p>

"1782","Request-scoped property in controllers","<p>I'm relative new to Spring so there is a thing not very obvious for me. Namely, the fact that controllers are singletons. I agree that this is a good approach but this doesn't let me implement a thing that I used to implement with other frameworks.</p>

<p>I build a web application which throughout uses AJAX requests. I have controllers hierarchy with <code>BaseController</code> as parent and all other controllers extend it.</p>

<p>Controller actions which should return response to the client are annotated with the <code>@ResponseBody</code> annotation and return serialized JSON string to the client.</p>

<p>Method <code>createJSONResponse()</code> which performs this serialization is implemented in the <code>BaseController</code> and the main idea here is that each of the child controllers' actions populates a map <code>Map&lt;String, Object&gt; responseMap</code> with the required for client data and then this map is accessed in the <code>BaseController</code> and serialized. </p>

<p>I don't want to create new instance of <code>responseMap</code> in every action and I don't want to pass it every time as a parameter for <code>createJSONResponse()</code>.</p>

<p>I achieved this with other framework by declaring <code>responseMap</code> in <code>BaseController</code> as <code>protected</code> property.</p>

<p>I can't do this with Spring since all controllers are singletons and I will not have new instance of <code>responseMap</code> with every request.</p>

<p>I'm not sure making <code>BaseController</code> request scoped is a good idea.</p>

<p>I created a helper class as request scoped bean and declared responseMap in this helper. Then I injected this bean as <code>@Autowired</code> in <code>BaseController</code>. I also moved out <code>createJSONResponse()</code> method in this helper. Then from controllers I populate this map as <code>helper.responseMap.add(&lt;somedata&gt;)</code> and call <code>helper.createResponseMap()</code>.</p>

<p>In this case <code>responseMap</code> becomes empty in <code>createResponseMap()</code>, it does not contain data populated in controller action. It somehow goes out that <code>responseMAp</code> is not thread-safe and it is moving from thread to thread with each async request.</p>

<p>Are there any ways to achieve functionality I need? </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>SOLVED BY A WORKAROUND:</strong>
Solved the problem by instantiating responseMap before every request and adding to the HttpServletRequest object in request interceptor. Then createJSONResponse() method and responseMap population methods refer to the getRequestMap() method which gets responseMap from the HttpServletRequest. </p>

<p>P.S. Still will be glad to know the better solution.</p>

<p>The first function that I have made moves the cursor to a specific set of coordinates within the game window. It does this by finding the client area then adding the set coordinates and then moving the cursor there. However, it appears that each time SetCursorPos is called, it moves twice: first to the correct spot, the to (0,0). I'm not sure what's causing this, and I've spent hours googling and debugging to no avail. Everything works correctly except that it moves twice. I'm using Windows 8 and compiling with Code::Blocks.</p>

<pre><code>   /**
     * @constructor
     */
    function Parser(json)
    {   
        return $.when(
            this.delete().then(this.insert(json)),
            this.doSomething(),
            this.doSomethingElse().then(this.update(json))
        ) 
    };
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what an example function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>Parser.prototype.doSomething = function()
{   
    var dfd = $.Deferred();

    exampleTask(dfd.reject, dfd.resolve);

    return dfd.promise();
};
</code></pre>

<p>From the JQuery docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the case where multiple Deferred objects are passed to jQuery.when,
  the method returns the Promise from a new ""master"" Deferred object
  that tracks the aggregate state of all the Deferreds it has been
  passed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I use .progress() to notify anybody that cares about the overall progress of the Parser? 
 e.g.</p>

<pre><code>var parser = new Parser(json);
parser.progress(function(prog){console.log(prog});
</code></pre>

"1806","How do I calculate distance between GPS co-ordinates on a processor with poor floating point support?","<p>I need to calculate the distance between GPS co-ordinates to calculate distance traveled. I've tried both the Haversine and Vincenty algorithms, which work fine on my desktop PC, but when I port the code to the dsPIC, they return 0 for points that are close (within several meters) due to a lack of floating point precision and poor implementations of sin and cos.</p>

<p>For my use case, my points will be no more than 10 meters apart and will all fall within 10km of each other. I've tried the following algorithm and the results seem ok:</p>

<pre><code>double dist(double latA, double lonA, double latB, double lonB)
{
    double latD = fabs(latA - latB) * 111.3;
    double lonD = fabs(lonA - lonB) * 111.3 * cos(latA * 3.14159265 / 180);

    return sqrt(latD*latD + lonD*lonD) * 1000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming the distance for every 1° is 111.3km, I use the pythagorean theorem to calculate distance. Is there any easy way to improve my algorithm? Or are there any other algorithms that don't depend on a highly accurate sin/cos?</p>

<p>I am using Apache Shiro <a href=""http://shiro.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shiro.apache.org/</a> for security. It worked fine until I added the <code>ExecutionHandler</code>. </p>

<p><em>The issue</em>: <br/>
Shiro's execution context is bound to the current thread in which you obtain the <code>Subject</code> object. So, if the <code>Subject</code> is obtained in the worker thread, but the business logic executes in a separate <code>ExecutionHandler</code> managed thread then the two execution contexts won't be connected as far as Shiro is concerned. Thus Shiro in the <code>ExecutionHandler</code> thread will fail to be aware that the <code>Subject</code> is in fact authenticated. So I'm getting Authentication errors.</p>

<p>It is possible to associate a given <code>Subject</code> with a <code>Runnable</code> before passing it to <code>Executor.execute()</code> so that the security context is maintained. See: <a href=""http://shiro.apache.org/subject.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shiro.apache.org/subject.html</a></p>

<p>Based on this I think need to find a way to associate the current Shiro <code>Subject</code> with the <code>ExecutionHandler</code> <code>Runnable</code>. </p>

<p>I'm still trying to fully understand the <code>ExecutionHandler</code> and <code>OrderedMemoryAwareThreadPoolExecutor</code> implementations. </p>

<p>Basically I need to call <code>subject.associateWith(aRunnable)</code> just before <code>aRunnable</code> is passed to <code>Executor.execute(aRunnable)</code>.</p>

<p>Does anyone have thoughts on where/how I could hook Shiro into the mix?</p>

<p>I am working on a map of India in 500BCE. This raises a number of issues.</p>

<ol><li><b>Uncertainty.</b> Many of the places I want to map are uncertain, and can only be specified in approximate terms. Places fall into 3 categories: 
<ol><li>known places (like Rajagaha=Rajgir)</li>
<li>uncertain but with uniquely identifiable features (eg. ""on the road between Rajagaha and Nalanda"")</li>
<li>uncertain and non-unique (such as towns that are specified only as being in a certain region).</li></ol>

So, how should I approach this? The first category is unproblematic. For the second one I would like to indicate a place, while clearly alerting the user that it is no more than an educated guess. For the third, we can to no better than placing a list of towns (etc.) inside a region. Can this be captured in a useful way in KML?</li>

<li><b>Multiple Names.</b> Many of the places have multiple names, whether variant readings in the texts, or translated names in Chinese and so on. Is it possible to record a list of alternative names with the KML data. Of course, only one of these will be displayed, but the others are there for interfacing with other applications. For example, someone's reading a text, they come across a place name in Chinese, and Bingo! they can go to the map, which has the name in Pali.</li></ol>

    IMandel();
    IMandel(int aWidth, int aLength);

    //other stuff!
private:
    int max_iterations, thread_count, height, width;
    int* buffer; 
};

#endif
</code></pre>

<p><p> 
Therefore in my corresponding cpp file I have these constructors implemented respectively:</p>

<pre><code>//default constructor
IMandel::IMandel(){
    height = 10000;
    width = 10000;

    //this code segements gets repeated in every constructor! Messy!
    max_iterations = 255;
    thread_count = 1;
    buffer = new int[width*height];
}

IMandel::IMandel(int aWidth, int aLength){
    width = aWidth;
    height = aLength;

     //this code segements gets repeated in every constructor! Messy!
    max_iterations = 255;
    thread_count = 1;
    buffer = new int[width*height];
}

IMandel::IMandel(int threads, int aWidth, int aLength){
    thread_count = threads;
    width = aWidth;
    height = aLength;

     //this code segements gets repeated in every constructor! Messy!
    max_iterations = 255;
    buffer = new int[width*height];
}
</code></pre>

<p><p>
As you can see, my constructors are not healthy, they have repeated chunks of code everywhere, and that is terrible!
<p>
In java , I found a solution to this problem by using constructors call each other. Basically I re-use the constructors like the following (Java example):
<p></p>

<pre><code>public myClass(){
    this(1, 10000, 10000);
}

public myClass(int aWidth, int aLength){
   this(1, aWidth, aLentgh);
}

public myClass(int threads, int aWidth, int aLength){
   thread_count = threads;
   width = aWidth;
   height = aLength;
   max_iterations = 255;
   buffer = new int[width*height];
}
</code></pre>

<p><p>
As you can see int this Java example, there is no repeated code amongst the various constructors. 
Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way to achieve this same effect in C++?</li>
<li>If so how? Can you provide a sample?</li>
<li>If not, what solution do you recommend to fix the problem?</li>

This afternoon I tried running it under Mono/Apache/Ubuntu 10.10. To my surprise, it worked - except for the image resampling.</p>

<p>It seems the libraries underlying Mono's Graphics/GDI+ implementation don't implement the bi-cubic interpolation mode.  (See <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2685084/mono-ignores-graphics-interpolationmode"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2685084/mono-ignores-graphics-interpolationmode</a> ).</p>

<p>So I'm looking for a library that can do high quality image resizing.  I'm willing to put in the effort to interop to it from C# since this is important functionality and I'd like to be able to run under mono if at all possible.  I don't really need any other graphics processing capabilities - just resize.</p>

<p>Follow up: as suggested below ImageMagick works really well for this and was pretty easy to interop to.

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

//Initialise Windows module
int WINAPI WinMain (HINSTANCE hThisInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpszArgument, int nFunsterStil)

{
 //Define the serial port precedure

 int freq = 4;

 {
 //Fire the flash (open the serial port, and immediately close it)
 hSerial = CreateFile(""COM1"",GENERIC_WRITE, 0, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0);
 CloseHandle(hSerial);

 //Sleep in between flashes for specified duration
 Sleep (1000/freq);
 }

 return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is have the flash fire at a frequency defined by the user (in Hz). Basically, this program, plus a dialog box that allows the user to choose values for 'freq' and 'iterations' before the thing starts flashing.</p>

<p>I have successfully implemented dialog boxes in previous projects by including the following code at the start of my main.c file:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef WIN32
#include &lt;w32_dialogs.h&gt;
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>And using something along these lines where the actual dialog box should occur:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef WIN32
    edit_dialog(NULL,""Dialog Title"", ""Please enter variable:"", variable,260);
#endif#
</code></pre>

<p>So, based on this, I have updated the code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

#ifdef WIN32
#include &lt;w32_dialogs.h&gt;
#endif

//Initialise Windows module
int WINAPI WinMain (HINSTANCE hThisInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpszArgument, int nFunsterStil)

{
 //Define the serial port precedure    
 HANDLE hSerial;

 int freq = 4;
 int iterations = 10;
 int x;

 //Buffers for variable entry into text box  
 char freq_buf[256];
 char iterations_buf[256];

 //Convert dialog buffer to useable values
 sprintf( freq_buf, ""%lf"", freq);
 sprintf( iterations_buf, ""%lf"", iterations);

 #ifdef WIN32
        edit_dialog(NULL,""Enter frequency"", ""Please enter frequency:"", freq_buf,260);
 #endif#

 #ifdef WIN32
        edit_dialog(NULL,""Enter iterations"", ""Please enter number of iterations:"", iterations_buf,260);
 #endif#

 freq = atoi(freq_buf);
 iterations = atoi(iterations_buf);

 for ( x = 0; x &lt; iterations; x++)
 {
 //Fire the flash (open the serial port, and immediately close it)
 hSerial = CreateFile(""COM1"",GENERIC_WRITE, 0, 0, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, 0);
 CloseHandle(hSerial);

 //Sleep in between flashes for specified duration
 Sleep (1000/freq);
 }

 return 0;

<p>However, this does not compile. I am using Dev-C++ (I usually use VC++ but couldnt get it to work there either)</p>

"1850","Objective-C should I be using NSError and why presentError function not working","<p>I am creating an application on iPhone where I am taking code written and Java and translating into Objective-C, as the app must work similarly in both Android and iPhone. Now problems of course are there are certain areas where the languages differ quite a bit, and can be difficult to implement just right.</p>

<p>One of the areas where it is of course different is you cannot create NSMutableArrays or NSMutableDictionaries which only accepts objects of a certain type. So when I am creating the getters and setters for these objects, I have been doing this, example below:</p>

<pre><code>  -(void)setPerson:(NSMutableArray *)personList_p
    {
        BOOL bAllowed = YES;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; [personList_p count]; i++)
        {
            if(![[personList_p objectAtIndex:i] isKindOfClass:[Person class]])
            {
                bAllowed = NO;
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                bAllowed = YES;
            }
        }

        if(bAllowed)
        {
        personList_i = personList_p;
        }
        else
        {
        //Raise error here
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Now originally I was using NSRaise Exception, but after doing reading up on it, it recommends against this as exception handling is resource intensive and should not be used for this type of situation. So NSError I read was a good solution, so I was reading up on this guide</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/04/cocoa-tutorial-using-nserror-to-great-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/04/cocoa-tutorial-using-nserror-to-great-effect/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is two fold, if I decide to use NSError should, is it best practice to declare the NSError object in the method, i.e like this</p>

<pre><code>-(void)setPerson:(NSMutableArray *)personList_p : (NSError **)error
</code></pre>

<p>Or is it okay just to declare the error within the else statement above, like this</p>

<pre><code> NSError *error = nil;
         NSMutableDictionary* details = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
                [details setValue:@""Invalid object passed into Array, object must be of type Person."" forKey:NSLocalizedDescriptionKey];
                error = [NSError errorWithDomain:@""Invalid Object"" code:200 userInfo:details];
                NSLog(@""%@"", [error localizedDescription]);
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, in the guide I linked above, in the conclusion the author says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this example, I am checking to see if the error is still nil after
  my message call. If it is no longer nil I know that an error occurred
  and that I need to display it to the user. Apple provides a built in
  method to do this with a call to presentError: on the NSApplication
  instance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and he uses this line of code here</p>

<pre><code>[NSApp presentError:error];
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work for me, I do not get an autocomplete option with this code, just says use of undeclared identifier. Am I missing something obvious here?</p>

<p>Also, just to be sure, is the method I am using, the best method to go about ensuring the user sends in an array with the correct object types? Or is there another method which could be used which would achieve the same thing but in a more efficient manner.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Additional question, would it be such a bad idea to use NSException, as the problem with NSError is the app carries on, I am considering having it so if they do pass in an array with an invalid object, that it does just cause the application to crash and raise an exception. Is there any major reason why I shouldn't do this??</p>

"1851","Should my DAL return DataTables or I...whatever<>?","<h2>EDIT 1</h2>

<p>I apologize but after reading the 2 suggested articles I still don't understand what I should use.  I understand that using IQueryable is not preferred for various reasons but does that eliminate IEnumerable as well? Is a DataTable really my best option?</p>

<p>In short, I guess, what is the preferred Return type?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>I have the following simple LINQ query that I want to abstract out into a DAL.  What is the type of var and therefore what type should my method be?  </p>

<p>When I hover over it in VS it says <code>IQueryable&lt;T&gt;</code> but when I put in a breakpoint and run it it <em>seems</em> to call itself IEnumerable.  Which is correct and how should I declare my method?</p>

<p>Like this --></p>

<pre><code>        public static DataTable SearchPerson(string SearhParam)
    {
        ConnectDBDataContext context = new ConnectDBDataContext();

"1854","Turning Chinese line breaks on and off","<p>I am typesetting a document in Chinese with spaces between words, for the purpose of making it easier for learners. Because of this, I am typesetting most of my document with no line-breaks between words. Because Chinese words are generally pretty short, this will generally not cause any big problems.</p>

<p>However, in some parts of my document, I  will need to use Chinese line breaks, as defined by \XeTeXlinebreaklocale ""zh"" (or similar) to avoid over-filled boxes. Basically, those are regular paragraphs of Chinese text, which will not break at all without this option turned on. However, this appears to be a document specific parameter that I can not easily change in only parts of the document.</p>

<p>Any ideas for how I can deal with this problem?</p>

<p>I added to my comment below that I would like to type Chinese text without spaces, as ""我喜欢学中文"", in which case line breaks would use a Chinese locale, as well as space delimited Chinese (non-standard) ""我 喜欢 学 中文"", in which case no line breaks are allowed in the middle of words (or possibly only allowed with very high tolerance).</p>

<p>If I just turn on \XeTeXlinebreaklocale ""zh"" (or use a CJK package, I believe), all words will be broken according to Chinese rules, in which case I risk getting the ""中文"" in ""我 喜欢 学 中文"" broken over two lines.</p>

"1855","Java Spring/Struts2 Web Project - Working on JSP without build deploy but still in git repo... Possible?","<p>I can't seem to find an answer to this.
Heavy web stack - spring, struts2, hibernate...
Every project I work on I'm faced with a conflict between front end and backend Dev.
The project will rely upon the app being built and deployed for it to start (ie spring application-context.xml will fail without classes) so we can't just deploy the git repo.
Yet front end development will want the changes to be visible without waiting for a full build deploy.
They can work on the live project and then reintegrate changed files back into the source repo but this exposes the project to risks such as lost work or incomplete/incorrect checkin due to added complexity.</p>

<p>Is there some magic bullet that will let ID work on a project with their preferred plain text editor where they won't need to wait for build cycles to preview changes? there must be something better than these options? Eclipse maven 'run on server' can still take 30 or 60 seconds to get a preview up (drives me crazy as a backend dev).</p>

<p>Frameworks like play are not an option.</p>

<p>I'm just thinking now maybe having a static web module that builds with a dynamic web module may be the answer? Ie have maven pick files up from both? So then the frontend guys can just deploy the static content and work on it.</p>

<p>Say, I tested the javascript URI hack (javascript:) and it doesn't seem to work even on Internet Explorer, and I don't know of any way of injecting a script through the href attribute of an A tag, would there be any risk in allowing my users to type whatever they like (as long as there's either a valid alphanumeric protocol such as *:// or www. which will have a http:// placed prior to it) in the href of  tags?</p>

<p>Please note that I'm not considering linking to malicious sites, I want to know if hackers would be able to inject scripts/cookies/whatever through the href of an  tag without the user clicking on it!</p>

<p>Now it sounds a little redundant to have a href attribute run anything without its  tag being clicked, but anyway, is there a way for a hacker to inject malicious code/javascript in the document through the href attribute?</p>

One would type, for example, $\sin(a)\cos(b)+\sin(b)\cos(a)$ and it would intelligently associate it with the sum of sines formula. I know this would be no trivial service but I find it would be a great tool.</p>

<p>I would ideally like to use AES for encryption, but this requires adding the aes key to the web.config in plaintext itself, which seems useless to me. (from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/8777147"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/8777147</a>)</p>

"1870","How do I get the right number of pauses after a list in beamer?","<p>When I do an list (or list-type) in beamer with the automatic pausing between each item, then there seems to be something wrong with the pauses afterwards.  If I put in a <code>\pause</code> afterwards then I get a double pause, but if I leave it out then I get no pause.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}[&lt;+-&gt;]
\item On the first slide
\end{itemize}
\pause
On the first or third slide
\end{frame}
\end{document}
</code></pre>

<p>With the <code>\pause</code>, I get three pages.  Without, I get only one.  I want two.</p>

<p>Another example (added in edit) of similarly annoying behaviour is in trying to pause <em>within</em> an item:</p>

<pre><code>\documentclass{beamer}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
On the first slide
\pause
\begin{itemize}[&lt;+-&gt;]
\item On the second slide.
\pause
Should be on the third slide, actually on the fourth
\item On the fourth slide
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\end{document}
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on?  More importantly, how do I stop it doing that? It's really annoying!</p>

<p>(Added in edit): In response to Michael Underwood's answer: the <code>\pause</code> command is so useful and so intuitive that I'd really like to use it.  I know that for complicated stuff, I need to use more refined commands, but this doesn't <em>feel</em> complicated.  It seems that as soon as I use an automatic list (which is itself a useful shortcut to a more complicated command) then I have to abandon using the <code>\pause</code> command.  Why can't I use both?</p>

<p>I'm using beamer version 3.07 from TeXLive 2008.  I'm quite happy to upgrade if it will get rid of the problem.</p>

"1873","Display actual image size within existing PHP code","<p>I am building a <a href=""http://www.jordangabrielarts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Wordpress website</a>. Please don't mind that I'm not working on a local or testing server, or my code. It's messy at the moment while I try to figure out this programming bit. By going to my website, you will see a row of images along the top, which is within a jcarousel.</p>

<p>It works, but if you hit next until you get to the ""portrait"" photo, there is a gap. The gap is because I have to set a width in pixels within my HTML or CSS for the carousel to work correctly. If set to <code>auto</code>, the carousel collapses. Makes sense to me, but it's frustrating that I cannot work around that. I want the ""landscape"" and ""portrait"" photos to have an identical height of 427, but the width I want it to self-adjust to the actual image size.</p>

<p>So I think I understand this bit after playing around for 3 days - I cannot tell you how many carousel codes I've used. Originally I thought that was the problem, and some were. I found out, widths of each image slide are set within the JavaScript, so if I gave it a width of 640, I would get the same result as I am getting now.</p>

<p>My first question is this:</p>

<p>I'm calling my images from a directory on my server, written specifically for Wordpress (<a href=""http://bavotasan.com/2010/get-files-from-directory-using-php/"" rel=""nofollow"">author</a>). Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$uploads = wp_upload_dir();

if ($dir = opendir($uploads['basedir'].'/picture-atlantic')) {
$images = array();
while (false !== ($file = readdir($dir))) {
    if ($file != ""."" &amp;&amp; $file != "".."") {
        $images[] = $file; 
    }
}
closedir($dir);
}

echo '&lt;ul&gt;';
foreach($images as $image) {
echo '&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""';
echo $uploads['baseurl'].'/picture-atlantic/'.$image;
echo '"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
 }
echo '&lt;/ul&gt;';
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it's calling from the picture-atlantic directory and displaying it within an unordered list, which is required for some reason with my jcarousel.</p>

<p>Finally: how can I use this same code to get my images, but also display them at their actual sizes? In the code above, if I define the width and height, it does it for all the images. However, as I mentioned before, I have portrait pictures that use different dimensions. I found this code: erikastokes.com/php/how-to-get-image-size-with-php.php, but I'm not sure how to implement it in my existing code.</p>

<p>Could someone please help me rewrite it?</p>

"1884","Is code pruning related to obfuscation?","<p>From my research, many obfuscation/optimization packages include a feature called <strong>pruning</strong> where the software will remove dead code during processing.</p>

<p>The following packages include both obfuscation and code pruning as a feature (to name a few):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/smartassembly/"" rel=""nofollow"">RedGate SmartAssembly</a> (.NET)</li>
<li><a href=""http://preemptive.com/products/dotfuscator/overview"" rel=""nofollow"">Preemtive Dotfuscator</a> (.NET)</li>

<li><a href=""http://proguard.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">ProGuard</a> (Java)</li>
</ul>

<p>I see the common thread that both operations require scanning and analyzing an assembly, but I'm curious if the two features are or even could be fundamentally related.  The reason I am asking is that we are considering disabling code pruning in our environment (unrelated issue), but our concern is that it could potentially decrease the effectiveness of the obfuscation process and thus protect our Intellectual Property less.</p>

"1889","SQL database testing: How to capture state of my database for rollback","<p>I have a SQL server (MS SQL 2005) in my development environment.  I have a suite of unit tests for some .net code that will connect to the database and perform some operations.  If the code under test works correctly, then the database should be in the same (or similar) state to how it was before the tests.</p>

<p>However, I would like to be able to roll back the database to its state from before the tests run.  One way of doing this would be to programmatically use transactions to roll back each test operation, but this is difficult and cumbersome to program; it could easily lead to errors in the test code.</p>

"1893","Design of common featureset - splitting data and code","<p>I am new to Perl programming and would like to get some ideas on what is the best way to structure a piece of code in the form of Perl module(s). It should provide a framework such that the 'data' can grow/shrink without impacting the code.</p>

<p>Essentially, the program needs to perform 3 different things ('data' portion):</p>

<ol>
<li>Gather text from multiple files(entire text) depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C' respectively, for argument's sake) is installed on the host. The list of files will grow and should be stored in a simple externalized file which should be easily editable.</li>
<li>Run OS commands on the operating system (Linux) and capture the output of the commands into a text file, depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C', for argument's sake) is installed on the host.</li>
<li>Run Database commands on a specific database (lets call it 'DBA', 'DBB', 'DBC', 3 databases corresponding to 3 hosts) and capture the output to a text file, depending upon which RPM (RPM name = 'A', 'B', 'C' respectively, for argument's sake) is installed on the host.</li></ol>

<p>I need to program the logic in such a way that:</p>

<ol>
<li>There has to be a ""RPM to file/command/DB-command"" mapping which is easily editable separately from the main Perl program</li>
<li>The number of files, their names/location + OS + DB commands is expected to change and therefore should be easily editable separately from the main Perl program</li>
<li>The RPM name and the mapping to the above data can change and therefore should be easily editable separately from the main Perl program</li></ol>

<p>Ideas that I have researched so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hash of Hashes (in a Perl module)</li>
<li>Array of Arrays (in a Perl module)</li>
<li>external XML</li>
<li>external Key-value pair file</li>
</ol>

<p>Any guidance on whats the easiest and simplest way to go about doing this? Illustrative code would be greatly beneficial.</p>

"1897","SQL Server lock issue (distributed transactions with WCF)","<p>I'm having a problem with distributed transactions.</p>

<p>I'm using SQL Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, .Net 4.0.</p>

<p>Here's what I actually want to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have a buffer database (named A)</li>
<li>I have another database (named B)</li>
<li>I want to send data from database A to database B through a WCF webservice (SOAP over HTTP, A and B not on the same machine)</li>
<li>If the data is successfully sent to database B, data is removed from database A</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please note that this is a <strong>very</strong> simplified description of the problem I'm currently having. In my real application, I'm not replicating data between multiple SQL Server instances (see update at the end of the post).</em></p>

<p>Everything is part of a transaction, so the whole operation is atomic.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm currently trying to do sequentially (everything in a transaction):</p>

<ol>
<li>I read a chunk from database A (say 50 rows)</li>
<li>I update rows read in step 1 (I actually set the boolean <code>Sent</code> column of rows with the value <code>true</code>, so in the future I know that these rows are sent)</li>
<li>I consume (client side) a WCF webservice (SOAP 1.2, <code>wsHttpBinding</code>) that is part of the transaction flow (blocking synchronous call). The webservice request sends the data read in step 1</li>
<li>The webservice implementation (server side) inserts data in database B (data that is contained in the webservice request)</li>
<li><ul>
<li>if no exception is received from the server, data with the <code>Sent</code> value as <code>true</code> are removed from database A</li>
<li>if a specific <code>FaultException</code> is received from the server, data with the <code>Sent</code> value as true are removed from database A</li>
<li>for other <code>FaultExceptions</code> and other exceptions (endpoint not found, or anything else), data with the <code>Sent</code> value as <code>true</code> are not removed from database A </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note: there are actually multiple buffer databases (A1, A2, A3..., AN) and multiple target databases (B1,.... BN). There are N threads to deal with N databases.</em></p>

<p>If I run my server and my client, everything is working just fine. Data is ""transferred"" atomically per chunks from database A to database B.
When I brutally stop my client in the middle of the transaction (process killed), most of the time everything is fine (i.e. data is not removed from database A nor added to database B).</p>

<p><strong>But sometimes (this is my actual problem), my database B becomes locked. The only option to unlock it is to terminate the server process.</strong></p>

<p>When the problem occurs, I can see in MSDTC that there is an active transaction (note that in the screenshot there are 3 transactions as I'm currently dealing with 3 buffer databases and 3 target databases, but sometimes there is only 1 transaction even if there are 3 DB).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/PQKry.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I see that database B is locked when trying to run a <code>SELECT</code> againt database B. As you can see in the picture below, my <code>SELECT</code> request is blocked by session ID 67 which corresponds to an <code>INSERT</code> in database B by the server process.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/UAW2z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The lock remains forever (no transaction timeout, even after 1+ hour) until the server process is terminated. I can't validate or cancel the transaction in MSDTC, I get a warning saying that ""<code>it cannot be aborted because it is not ""In Doubt""</code>"".</p>

<p><strong>Why does the database B remained locked? If the client is terminated, shouldn't the transaction fail and the lock on database B be released after some timeout?</strong></p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my pattern/design with distributed transactions a valid and robust design?</li>
<li>What could cause my database B to be locked for infinite time if my client's transaction is brutally terminated?</li>
<li>What should I change (config and/or code and/or design) to make it work as expected (i.e. if my client process dies/crashes, I want the transaction to be aborted so the database B is not locked)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I do think I over-simplified the description of my actual use case. It looks like I'm actually doing a simple data replication between multiple SQL Server instances. That's not well explained (my bad), that's not what I'm trying to achieve.</p>

<p>I'm not simply duplicating data. I read from A on machine M1 then write to B on machine M2, but what's written is not what I've read but some calculated value that comes from what was read.
I'm pretty sure SQL Server replication services could handle business computation for me, but I can't go this way for some reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't use SQL Server replication because I'm actually not responsible of the server side (which writes to database B). I'm even not sure that there will be SQL Server on the other side (could be a Java backoffice with MySQL, PostgreSQL or anything)</li>
<li>I can't use SQL Server service broker or any message-oriented-middleware (which would fit IMO) for same reason (potentially heterogeneous databases and environments)</li>
<li>I can't change the webservices thing because the interface is now defined and fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm stuck by WCF, and I can't even change the binding configuration to use MSMQ or whatever because of interoperability requirements. MSMQ is great for sure (I'm already using it in another part of the project), but it's Windows only. SOAP 1.2 is a standard protocol, and SOAP 1.2 transactions are standard too (<code>WS-Atomic</code> implementation).</p>

<p>Maybe the WCF transaction thing is not a good idea, actually.</p>

<p>If I have understood correctly how it actually works (please correct me if I'm wrong), it simply allows to ""continue"" the transaction scope on server side, which will require a transaction coordinator to be configured on server side, which probably breaks my interoperability needs (again, there could be a database on server side that does not integrate well with the transaction coordinator).</p>

<pre><code>    // let's assume xmldoc contains the above document.

<p>This will give me the <em>'title'</em> of the first book i.e. <em>""Gone with the Wind!""</em>.  Now, my question here is: Is this the efficient method to obtain the 'title' of the <strong>first</strong> book?</p>

<p>I am afraid, internally jQuery might be parsing the titles of all the books and then returning me the <em>first()</em>. I wonder, if am I wasting the CPU-cycles in parsing the books that I am not interested in?</p>

sql = ""set rowcount 0 select "" &amp; flds &amp; "" from [TABLE] where Name = '"" &amp; name &amp; ""'""

<p>From what I understand, a parameterized query will protect against SQL injection in the WHERE clause (in this case, the <code>name</code> field.</p>

<p><code>flds</code> is a comma-separated list of parameters that the users wants returned. As it is obvious, it is <strong>very</strong> vulnerable to SQL injection. </p>

<p>One idea I have to secure my code is to have a statically generated dict of valid fields, split the <code>flds</code> string by "","", verify each one of the values against the dict, and construct the SQL query that will consist of all the fields that are present in the dict.</p>

<p>It seems to me that although this method will work for security, it will require me to modify the static list at every change in the database (however rare those are). </p>

Weeks prior, our old server was able to handle traffic, maxed out, at 20mil.</p>

<p>What could be the problem here? I don't understand. Fonts are already embedded. Even if I try with a font like Arial, still doesn't work. The value of percent is correct since it removes the child when it reaches 100 in the server too. And again, the text functionality works perfect in localhost, but not in the server.</p>

  <p>Stop using new so much. I can't see
  any reason you used new anywhere you
  did. You can create objects by value

  advantages to using the language. You
  do not have to allocate everything on
  the heap. Stop thinking like a Java
  programmer</p>

"1925","Creating files in NTFS root folder","<p>Introduction:
I'm attempting (and in part succeding) in replacing a number of folders with mounted VHDs in Windows Server 2008 R2, in an attempt to emulate UNIX' bahaviour with bind- or loop-mounts. This has proven to reduce a number of problems related to extreme fragmentation due to a mix of large and small files and the occasional and unpredictable rewriting thereof. (A third party app is doing what it wants, and I don't have the power to stop it.) It also makes it possible to snapshot in a reasonable way without duplicating everything. </p>

<p>The images are obviously regenerated as needed after the app breaks everything. (cp -aT oldmount newmount)</p>

<p>Problem:
If the VHD image contains a NTFS filesystem, Windows requires administrator perms in order to create files (but not folders) in the filesystem root directory. This breaks the app when it attempts to make such files. (No, it is not an option to make the image root one folder up in the hierarchy). Thus far, I've solved this by using vFAT filesystems, which don't do any perm checking, but it would be very nice to have a few of the NTFS features like sparse files and per-file compression.</p>

<p>I have tried fiddling with the perms I could think of, but ""Full control"" does not entail creating files, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>TL;DR:
How can I goad Windows Server 2008 R2 into letting users create and write files in the top-level directory of a mounted NTFS file system?</p>

<p>Addition:
The app runs as my normal user ttbomk. I gave my both ""Everyone"" and my user ""Full control"" permissions, and set my user as the owner of the mount point (the root folder of the mount). I can create folders and edit existing files with no problems, but when creating a file (right click, new, text document) I get a UAC confirmation dialogue with title ""Destination Folder Access Denied"", text ""You need to confirm this operation.; [name(not path) of mount]; Date created: [Creation date of mount]"" and options to Continue, Skip or Cancel. When creating a file manually like this it's just an annoyance. The app just fails, silently for a while then with great spectacle when the unwritten data is needed. </p>

It's when I run the app from tomcat that it consequentially displays the language from the language_en.properties file, not my default file language.properties. And when I try to change the locale with ?locale=no (norwegian) nothing happends to the language on the site, but the log shows that the locale is actually changed to ""no"".</p>

"1934","PHP mysql refresh select data","<p>Some code starts with selecting data then check if row numbers are 0 to insert then continue the normal process. The problem is that the normal process is depending on the <code>select</code> statement which does not exist because it was stored before the <code>insert</code>. How can I refresh data request inside PHP without ajax or anything related to html? Here's an example to explain:</p>

<pre><code>$user = $_GET['user']; // not stored user
$select = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE username = "".$user);
$row = mysql_fetch_array($select);
$rownum = mysql_num_rows($select);
if(!$rownum){
     mysql_query(""INSERT INTO table (username, something) VALUES ('$user', 1)"");
}

/* Here comes the problem */
if($row['something'] == 0){
   die(""Not found !""); // THIS if returns true since it was not found at first place before inserting 
                      // i want it to refresh the $select data so it could be read as 1

}
</code></pre>

<p>How I solved it so far is by repeatedly using the <code>$select</code> and <code>$row</code> code below the <code>insert</code> statement</p>

<pre><code>if(!$rownum){
     mysql_query(""INSERT INTO table (username, something) VALUES ('$user', 1)"");
}
$select = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE username = "".$user);

<p>I'm nearly done writing a free app for iPhone, and I'm at the stage where I'm going to put ads into the app.  I've had mixed success in the past with iAd (their fill rates have been atrocious recently, and their payouts have cut by about 75% over the past 4 months or so), and would like to know how much ad revenue you, the community, has seen from the various ad APIs you've used for your iPhone apps.</p>

<p>This isn't a request for opinion, i.e. which is 'better', only what kinds of numbers you're seeing.  I don't need absolute figures, but 'iAd pays x% higher than AdMob, and y% lower than AdSense' would be extremely helpful to me as I make my decision as to which ad API to integrate into my App.</p>

<p>Also, have you had any experience or success with integrating multiple ad APIs into the same app?  That's something I'm considering doing in my current iAd-filled apps (particularly my iPad app, which has yet to receive a single impression after nearly 60,000 requests)... something like:
1) Request-from-iAd
2) if that fails, request-from-adSense
3) if that fails, request-from-adMob
4) if that fails, ... etc.</p>

"1936","c++/cli wrapper for polymorphic native classes","<p>We are writing a c++/cli wrapper for native code that is polymorphic and would like to extend the polymorphism into the non-native side as much as possible. So far, given a c++/cli class instance it is easy to retrieve the underlying native class but the trouble comes when trying to determine which c++/cli wrapper to use for a given native class instance. It would be nice to be able to avoid a switch statement here, but how? Is there a more elegant object-oriented solution?</p>

<p>Note that in the following code I use a prefix of M for C++/CLI types (e.g. FresnelScatterer is a native class and MFresnelScatterer is the C++/CLI wrapper class for it).</p>

<p>The native c++ base class and inherited class:</p>

<pre><code>class Scatterer

    // Some virtual functions here...
};

{
    m_Scatterer = scatter;

        FresnelScatterer* sca = new FresnelScatterer();
        return sca;

<p>An example where going from C++/CLI -> native C++ works nicely is here:</p>

{
    m_Scene-&gt;scattererList.push_back(mScatterer-&gt;convertXMLdata());
}

{
    switch (m_Scene-&gt;scattererList[i]-&gt;GetType())

"1941","How to replace macros with a grammar-based parser?","<p>I need a parser for an exotic programming language. I wrote a grammar for it and used a parser generator (PEGjs) to generate the parser. That works perfectly... except for one thing: macros (that replace a placeholder with predefined text). I don't know how to integrate this into a grammar. Let me illustrate the problem:</p>

<p>An example program to be parsed typically looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>instructionA parameter1, parameter2
instructionB parameter1
instructionC parameter1, parameter2, parameter3
</code></pre>

<p>No problem so far. But the language also supports macros:</p>

<pre><code>Define MacroX { foo, bar }
instructionD parameter1, MacroX, parameter4

Define MacroY(macroParameter1, macroParameter2) {
  instructionE parameter1, macroParameter1
  instructionF macroParameter2, MacroX
}

instructionG parameter1, MacroX
MacroY
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I could define a grammar to identify Macros and references to Macros. But in that case I don't know how I would parse the contents of a Macro, because it's not clear what the macro contains. It could be just one parameter (that's easiest), but it could also be several parameters in one macro (like MacroX in my example, which represents two parameters) or a whole block of instructions (like MacroY). And Macros can even contain other Macros. How do I put this into a grammar if it's not clear what the macro is semantically?</p>

<p>The easiest approach seems to be to run a preprocessor first to replace all the macros and only then run the parser. But in that case the line numbers get messed up. I want the parser to generate error messages containing the line number if there is a parse error. And if I preprocess the input, the line numbers do not correspond anymore.</p>

But using HQL I'm getting <code>unexpected token</code> error. When I researched this I found out that HQL doesn't allow <code>INNER JOINS</code> unless there is an association between two entities: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11741439/hql-left-join-on-the-same-table"">HQL, left join on the same table</a></p>

<p>So, I'm lost. To begin with, I'm frustrated why such a simple query isn't supported by GORM and now with HQL my question is: How do I perform an INNER JOIN on a subset? </p>

<p>What I've tried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unexpected token: ( near line 1, column 16 [ select c from ( select
  name, max(dateCreated) as maxTime from com.mine.Color
  group by name ) as t inner join Color c on c.name = t.name and
  c.dateCreated = t.maxTime ]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suspected that the second instance of <code>Color</code> was not being detected since the package name didn't get automatically prefixed to it. So reading other answers I tried:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unexpected token: ( near line 1, column 16 [ select c from ( select
  name, max(dateCreated) as maxTime from com.mine.Color

<p>Here's the interesting part:</p>

<li><p>The account merge was successful. I can log into the latest Skype for OS X, using the Microsoft credentials, or the old credentials. Either one of them works, and it keeps me logged in.</p></li>
<li><p>I can log into the <code>Skype for desktop</code> application on Windows 8 as well, but <em>only</em> with the old credentials. If I use the Microsoft ones, it kicks me out after a few seconds.</p></li>

<p>My question is, how do I get into the Metro Skype settings to tell it not to use my Windows 8 credentials, if at all possible? I've swiped and clicked and swooshed and sworn and nothing seems to change the display. I've been into my personal settings to tell Skype not to run in the background, but that seems to be it. I can't see a reference to Skype in my User settings under Windows 8 either.</p>

"1965","Is Tax Localization a good use for Workflow Foundation?","<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> We have both Winforms and MVC code that is being used to work on a nation wide multi-user platform that does lots of logistics for lots of users. Tax rules change per state and even per city or county. These tax rules make a huge difference for our industry. </p>

<p>The other issue is that rules can change based on legislation. The system will have to handle cases where before a date it works one way and then different after that date. This changeover will need to be entered into the system and tested before that date comes.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong> Use Workflow Foundation to create a time based system where our users can change and add rules that change the way taxes are calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have not used Workflow Foundation and searching has returned books to look at but not a lot of examples of people using this technology successfully. Is my scenario a good use of Workflow Foundation?(I think so.) If you have any experience with Workflow Foundation, any tips on making this work well? </p>

That is, there are chapters dedicated to things like how to install windows, how to backup files, make videos from your home movies, etc. These topics don't apply to small-biz office users and might scare away someone who just wants to learn things like ""you can press ctrl+c to copy, ctrl+v to paste!""</p>

"1996","Tool / plugin for laying out web page with minimal efforts applied on raw CSS","<p>First things first. I have been struggling while dealing with raw CSS to generate complex page layouts. It gets further complicated with browser vendors looking in different directions. Well, now that can't be changed.   </p>

<p>So after a lot of efforts I started looking for:  </p>

<ol>
<li>A WYSIWYG editor that would take in content and allow me to define the desired layout and magically generate CSS that would honor most of the latest browsers, while also taking into account the liquid &amp; fluid attributes of the layout  </li>
<li>jQuery plugin that would take care of content arrangement complexity while just taking in inputs for the desired layout.  </li>
</ol>

<p>I haven't been able to find anything for the first quest. <strong>I'd like to know if there is any such WYSIWYG editor out there</strong>. There are many CSS editors but they don't abstract the raw CSS. One needs to know CSS thoroughly and that IMHO beats the need of such an editor. Notepad or a regular IDE is good enough.  </p>

<p>For the second point, I came across <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/997314/jquery-layout-manager"">this thread</a> on <strong>stackoverflow</strong>. Now this put me in a problem of abundance (not a bad thing BTW). This post has links to several jQuery plugins that do the trick. Some of them are:  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://layout.jquery-dev.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery UI.Layout Plug-in</a>  </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/jquery-plugin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">jLayout jQuery Plugin</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/layoutmanager"" rel=""nofollow"">Docking Layout Manager</a></li>

<p>And using the following code to detect necessity of use/and to apply it to the fields requiring it:</p>

<p>The reason to have the Interval is that elements are dynamically generated at run time (I use Angular JS). Unfortunately, ie support is a must, and the placeholder attributes are unsupported...</p>

<p>1) How can I force Placeholder.init() to be applied to all new input fields with the placeholder attribute? Is there any way to avoid a continual looping interval? I am aware of DomChange events (various), but as far as I know they are a) deprecated and b) unsupported in ie?</p>

<pre><code>        httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
        httpget = new HttpGet(""http://google.com"");
        HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httpget);

        if (entity != null) {

        }  
</code></pre>

<p>I need a timeout on the entire job (connecting, waiting &amp; reading - All together or separately).<br>
I tried setting timeout parameters just after <code>httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();</code> line:  </p>

<pre><code>        int timeout=10;
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(""http.socket.timeout"", timeout * 1000);
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(""http.connection.timeout"", timeout * 1000);
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(""http.connection-manager.timeout"", new Long(timeout * 1000));
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(""http.protocol.head-body-timeout"", timeout * 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>But it didn't worked (It timeouts after about 10 times more than the timeout I set).<br>
So I tried a thread to cancel request after a time using <code>httpget.abort()</code> &amp; <code>httpclient.getConnectionManager().shutdown()</code> just after <code>httpget = new HttpGet(""http://google.com"");</code> line like this:</p>

<pre><code>        (new Timer()).schedule(new java.util.TimerTask() {
            public void run() {
                httpget.abort();
                httpclient.getConnectionManager().shutdown();
            }
        },10000);
</code></pre>

<p>but it had no effect(Timer runs; but those two lines of code do nothing!)!!<br>
I also tried to use this:  </p>

<pre><code>URL url = new URL(""http://google.com"");
URLConnection con = url.openConnection();
con.setConnectTimeout(10000);
con.setReadTimeout(10000);
InputStream PIS = con.getInputStream();
</code></pre>

<p>but it was same as my first try (setting timeout parameters in <code>HttpClient</code>)!!  </p>

<p>What I'm trying to achieve is effectively a two column display with the left side (e.g. 160 pixels wide) having a background of grey, a central section of the page (e.g. 600 pixels) that is white and the remainder of the page to the right having the same as the left (grey). Note, I said grey to make it simple, I actually need something like:
background=""rgb(220,220,220) url('../images/bg.png') repeat-x;""</p>

<p>Which is a 1 pixel wide, 400 pixel height image to give a 'fade to grey' look.</p>

<p>However, I need the colours of each section to repeat to the bottom of the browser window, not just the height of the heighest div. All the examples I find make use of a footer/div at the bottom to snap the divs to the same height (or similar approach) and if the content is less than the height of the browser it just stops there.</p>

<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>btw, I'd rather not cheat by having a huge height giving scroll bars. 
also, when I say background color grey, I currently have a 400 height white to grey faded 1 pixel wide image that I overlay on top of grey to simulate a gradient.</p>

"2010","Is there a web log analyser that can understand processing time and parse querystring?","<p>Does anyone know of an web log analyser that can both report on the 'processing time' field that Apache can store (%D), and also parse querystrings intelligently? </p>

<p>I've looked into some of the usual suspects eg AWStats and Webalyser but none I've looked at seem to offer either of these features.</p>

<p>Ideally, you'd be able to report on specific querystring parameters rather than simple 'page' requests, eg if my server showed hits to:</p>

<p>/someurl?blah=X&amp;whatever=Y</p>

<p>/someurl?whatever=Y&amp;blah=Z</p>

<p>I'd like it to be able to parse that intelligently, so if I ask for a report where 'whatever=Y' both URLs would be grouped together, whereas if I report on 'blah=X', they would be counted separately?</p>

<p>Any suggestions of off-the-shelf tools that can do this? FOSS or otherwise. </p>

<p>Yes I realise that I can write some awk or sed scripts to parse this sort of thing myself but I'm looking for someone to have done that hard work for me and present it in a nice chart or what have you.</p>

"2015","In a datacontext are inserted values not available within the datacontext until after submitchanges?","<p>I'm going through an XML file of articles and the journalist(s) that wrote them. As we are adding the articles into _Data our datacontext we may come across a journalist that needs adding so we do this:</p>

<pre><code>newJourno = New journalist With {.name = strJournalist}
_Data.journalists.InsertOnSubmit(newJourno)
.articles_journalists.Add(New articles_journalist With {.id_journalist = newJourno.id,         .id_article = .id})
</code></pre>

<p>However subsequently we may come across this same journalist again and nothing is returned when we do this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim journo = _Data.journalists.Where(Function(s) s.name = strJournalist).SingleOrDefault
</code></pre>

<p>So it uses the code above again to insert the same journalist again. </p>

<p>Once all of our inserts are done we do a submitchanges. At this point it has a head fit:</p>

<p>INSERT statement conflicted with COLUMN FOREIGN KEY constraint 'FK_articles_journalists_journalists'. The conflict occurred in database 'blah', table 'journalists', column 'id'. The statement has been terminated.</p>

<p>From looking through the sql generated in sql profiler you can see that it is trying to add some journalists more than once, this will fail as the name must be distinct. The subsequent records that are trying to be inserted with these journalists are failing as the journalist wasn't updated.</p>

<p>Surely if I have a collection of journalists, add some to it and then look in my collection I should see all of them and not just the original ones. I can fudge it I guess by doing a submitchanges but that seems a bit silly.</p>

<p>If we don't include the last rule (RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?query=$1 [L,QSA]), the HTTPS and HTTP rules work perfectly however; When we add the last three lines our other rules stop working properly.</p>

<p>For example if we try to goto https:// www.domain.com/en/customer/login, it redirects to
http:// www.domain.com/index.php?query=en/customer/login.</p>

<p>It's like the last rule is being applied before the redirection is done and after the [L] flag indicating the the redirection is the last rule to apply.</p>

If I call <code>fetch</code> with the <code>add: true</code> option, there can be duplicate models in the collection.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Instead of removing all existing models (say with <code>id=1,2,3,4</code>) from the collection and inserting the newly fetched models (<code>id=1,2,3,5</code>), is it possible to do the following 2 operations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add only the new models <code>id=5</code>, resulting in a collection with <code>id=1,2,3,4,5</code>. Then render only the new Views (<code>id=5</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Add the new models <code>id=5</code> and remove the models not found in the new <code>fetch</code> (<code>id=4</code>). Then render the new Views (<code>id=5</code>) and remove the old Views (<code>id=4</code>)</p></li>
</ol>

"2027","iOS - ASIHTTPRequest - Trying to parse through responseString","<p>I've spent about 16 hours researching and attempting different code changes, but cannot figure this one out. I have an iOS app that consumes a website using ASIHTTPrequest: </p>

<pre><code>-(void)refresh{
    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString@""http://undignified.podbean.com/""];
    ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:url];
    [request startSynchronous];
    NSString *response = [request responseString];
    NSLog(@""%@"",response];
 }
</code></pre>

<p>The above code returns the website source and spits it out to the console via NSLog. The goal I'm trying to achieve from this is search through the 'responseString' for URLs ending in *.mp3, load those into an array and finally load the mp3 URLs into a UITableView.</p>

<p>To summarize: </p>

<ol>
<li>Consuming website data with ASIHTTPRequest</li>
<li>Trying to search through the responseString for all links that have *.mp3 extensions and load them into an array.</li>
<li>Add parsed links to UITableView.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think at this junction I have attempted too many things to make any sound judgements at this point. Any suggestions or nudges in the right direction would be greatly appreciative.</p>

<p>Below is an example of the response (HTML). Please note this is only a snippet as the entire HTML source is rather large, but this includes a section to the mp3 files:</p>

"2033","survival package, right censored data","<p>I account for right censored data in the analysis of my dataset. I am using the <code>survival</code> package - given cancer treatment tactics and when the patient last checked in with my clients clinic. </p>

<p>Is there a suggested method or manipulation to the standard <code>survival</code> package to account for <em>right-censored</em> data?</p>

<p>Our rows are unique individual patients...</p>

<p>Here are our columns that are filled out:</p>

<ul>
<li>List item</li>
<li>our treatment type (constant)</li>
<li>days since original diagnosis</li>
<li>'censored' which is the number of patients who were last heard on this day. Hence, We are          now uncertain if they are still alive or dead seen as they stopped attending the clinic. They should be removed from the probability estimate at all points in future. </li>
<li># of patients who died on that day (from original diagnosis)</li>
</ul>

<p>So do you recommend a manipulation of the standard survival package? Or using another package? I have seen <code>survSNP</code>, <code>survPRESMOOTH</code> and <code>survBIVAR</code> that may perhaps help. I want to avoid recalculations of the individual columns/fields and creating new objects of the R algorithm seeing as this is a small part of a very large dataset.</p>

Everything seems to be working fine over windows m/c: I can drag and drop a node into other node wihtout any problem. But, When I moved the same appliaction over ubuntu m/c, the drag is possible but the drop is not happening. I observed When I try to drop a node onto target node, the target is not seleted when i am on top. My source nodeimplemententd DragSourceAdapter and my target node implementes ViewerDropAdapter method.</p>

<p>I can see the following sequenc of call</p>

<pre><code>  dragStart(){//returning true}
  dragFinished(){geting event.doit= false}

But if libraries that implement FastCGI already have to go through the painstaking measures of implementing a secure and efficient TCP service, why not just write applications as a web server?  Is it less efficient for a front-end web server to implement a reverse proxy than it is for FCGI?  Or is the specification for FCGI that much simpler than that of HTTP?</p>

<p>Our ISP who provides our nameservers, only supports adding domains for UDP answers to their nameservers, so would be good to know which TLD's I cant use their nameservers for.</p>

<p>e.g. for French domain name nameserver hosting the following applies (and im sure ive seen it for others such) I just want a complete list of all TLDs which this is the case for;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AFNIC (the sole registrar of .fr domains) requires a nameserver query (via TCP port 53) prior >to pointing the nameservers. This is an unfortunate situation which is unique to AFNIC. </p>

"2043","Learning .NET if you already know several languages","<p>First, I'm not here to start some debate over which is better or more popular, etc. I have a simple question that I'm sure has many answers and I'm willing to listen to them all. Here's my basic background: self taught HTML, high school class in C++, self taught PHP, self taught MySQL/db programing/websites, self taught CSS, college class in JavaScript, self taught Python (purely for creating desktop games and applications. I also have extensivle knowledge in Microsoft based applications (beyond Office). Basically, what I'm saying is I can teach myself a lot and have a ton of knowledge in programing. So, here's the million dollar question:</p>

<p>How hard will it be to learn .NET?</p>

<p>I know it's a loaded question, so I'll level with everyone. In the past few years I've taken several sites that were designed in ASP with an MSAccess db and turned them into a PHP/MySql kick ass site (a little ego never hurts). The deal is I know a company that has sites run in the .NET framework with ASP pages, etc.</p>

<p>So, based on my background/experience, is it possible for me to learn .NET quickly and help them out? I realize that this is an extensive question/debate but I simply want to know how easily my experience can help me learn .NET and if it is worth saying 'yes I can help,' just give me a few weeks.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense, and thanks in advance, As I said, I'm looking for flat out info/criticism, not debates on whats better. If .NET is totally different, let me know, if I'm totally nuts and trying to compare apples with oranges tell me.</p>

<p>I want to check about 1000 links so i I used the Multi-CURL functionality and i do get all the headers, codes, the URL to which a URL redirected.</p>

<p>The Problem is that Multi-CURL executes in parallel adding all the URLs to curl_multi_add_handle and returns the results it gets and ignores the rest. </p>

<p>I know from the header which result i got back but i dont know which URL brought it. Is there an Identifier which URL i requested against a specific executed handle (may be something to do with curl_multi_info_read )?</p>

During the process I want it to individually import posts then update a progress bar and/or counter each time an import finishes.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that the progress updates all seem to be held back until the entire process is finished and then update all at the same time.</p>

<p>For example: rather than updating the page with 1/100 complete, then 2/100 complete, it waits to the end and then adds all 100 updates at the same time.</p>

<p>Hopefully my code will explain it better than I have :S</p>

<p>The php file at ajaxurl is returning what it should in the right places. For context, during the while loop, the php file returns a string like this:</p>

<pre><code>    100::Some Status Information
</code></pre>

<p>where 100 is the total number of lines that will be returned.</p>

<p>The loop runs the correct number of times and outputs all right information when it's complete... but it doesn't output item by item... it outputs all at the same time.</p>

<p>What am I missing? How can I get this to output each items status report individually?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can offer.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just some extra information, the <code>&lt;h3&gt;ImportProgress&lt;/h3&gt;</code> doesn't appear until AFTER the while loop is completed either! The whole lot appears at once!</p>

"2047","Java: How to initialize and fill final static ordered Map?","<p>I have a stemming algorithm in Java which requires a static final <code>HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;</code> pre-filled with about 30 000 records.</p>

<p>I need the map to keep records in the same order they are inserted (I got a hint I could use <code>LinkedHashMap</code>?).</p>

<p>I thought I could manually insert the values in the Java class file since this is the quickest way to load them in RAM (time / productivity is very important for this project) by using 30 000 calls like</p>

<pre><code>map.put(""Key"", ""Value"");
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, that java (or at least eclipse) allows only 65kb of code in any segment / method etc. So I ended up extending 11 classes and putting 65kb of <code>.put</code>s in a constructor or a <code>static { }</code>.</p>

<p>Everything was fine, but when I run it the order is scrambled. For so many rows I cannot track where did things go wrong, in the extending order or in the map.</p>

<p>So, please tell me what is the best way you would fill a final map in java with regards to performance.</p>

<p>P.S.: Loading and parsing the records from a file is far too slow...</p>

"2053","How can I unsubscribe from a queue in NServiceBus without restarting the publisher?","<p>OK, forgive me if my understanding / terminology are a little odd - I'm still getting to grips with the interaction between NSB and MSMQ.</p>

<p>Earlier today, I accidentally fired up our subscriber web application on my workstation using a production config file. This means my workstation registered itself with our production publisher app. I now can't work out how to get the publisher to stop publishing messages to my workstation, short of restarting the publisher service - which would be bad since it's a production system.</p>

<p>Looking in the queue manager on the publisher host system, I can see the private queue under Computer Management -> Services and Applications -> Message Queueing -> Outgoing Queues:</p>

<pre><code>DIRECT=OS:DYLAN_PC\private$\DylanApplicationInputQueue
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't see any mechanism for removing the queue or deleting the subscription. Even having replaced the config for my local subscriber app, when I start my local subscriber now, messages from our production environment are appearing on the queue. Which makes doing any useful work a bit tricky. Any pointers to relevant bits of documentation would be most appreciated...</p>

I need to set the cursor option <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131361.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">SQL_SOPT_SS_CURSOR_OPTIONS to SQL_CO_FFO_AF</a>. Right now I connect to the server using a connection string (no DSN). I am using <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131291.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">sqlsrv32.dll or Sqlncl10.dll</a>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to set the cursor option in a DSN (or other layer) between my tool and the MSSQL server?  The tool handles creating the cursor (or results set) and iterating through the result set in a way that seems to obscure any ability to manage it directly. It does allow for calling SQLSetConnectAttr() but as far as I can tell there's no way to set a cursor option in there.</p>

<p>All of this is an attempt to speed up retrieving data over a remote connection. In SQL Management Studio I get comparable response times to the local or remote DB, but in the automation tool the remote queries take hundreds of times longer, probably because it seems to be making a round trip to the sever for every row.</p>

"2056","Issue with jQuery.InArray() returning -1","<p>I am having an issue where <code>jQuery.InArray()</code> is returning -1 when I run a function, but I know that the values that I'm testing for are definitely in the array.</p>

<p>I know that they are in the array because if I console.log the values of the array right before I run <code>jQuery.inArray()</code> the values exist and display.  Here is an example of what I'm working with:</p>

<pre><code>/* -- In page.php -- */
images = [8, 13, 21, 32, 40, 56]; 


/* -- In script.js -- */
console.log('images-&gt;', images); 
//output  images-&gt; [8, 13, 21, 32, 40, 56]

var testingValue = 13;

console.log('inArray-&gt;', jQuery.inArray(testingValue, images)); //Should return 1
//output inArray-&gt; -1

console.log('inArray-&gt;', jQuery.inArray(13, images)); //Should return 1
//output inArray-&gt; -1

console.log('inArray-&gt;', jQuery.inArray(""13"", images)); //Should return -1
//output inArray-&gt; -1

console.log('inArray-&gt;', jQuery.inArray('13', images)); //Should return -1 
//output inArray-&gt; -1
</code></pre>

<p>All of these return <code>-1</code> even though the top two should return <code>1</code>.  The weird thing is that if I manually test for <code>jQuery.inArray(testingValue, images)</code> in the console, I do get the value 1.</p>

<p><strong>One thing to note:</strong>  The variable <code>images</code> is created in the php page that the js file is included in.  This shouldn't be an issue.</p>

<p><strong>Additional note:</strong> Yes, jQuery is included well before this part of the script runs.  Many other jQuery functions are running successfully before this one.</p>

<p>What I am wondering is if there are any gotchas to this function.  I have used it successfully in the past and can't see anything with my code which would prevent this from returning a proper value.</p>

For the most part this is working; I'm making movieClips in the library, giving them class names I then edit in FB 4.5. My rationale is for iOS it all has to be one big ass file anyway. I don't really want to make everything a swc and embed in Flash Builder, just want to make movieClips and edit their code in FB.</p>

<p>But, say I have made a ball in the Flash IDE. In the Library I give it a class name of 'Ball' that extends MovieClip. When I go back to Flash Builder in my main class I use </p>

<p><code>
var _ball:Ball = new Ball();
addChild (_ball)
</code></p>

<p>The code works and the ball is placed from library onto stage, however there is the ""?"" next to the Ball instantiation suggesting the type cannot be found or is not a compile time constant. I don't really want to make a custom class for Ball - although I'm pretty sure if I did and imported a custom Ball class it would find it and the '?' would go away, but is there not a way to force  Flash Builder 'see' the Flash IDE library objects/classes?</p>

    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This code is only executed the first time the cell is displayed (since after that the image is already on disk). In that case, the cell is loaded using:</p>

<pre><code>dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
    UIImage *savedImage = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:thumbPath];

    if(savedImage) {
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            self.image = savedImage; // refreshes the cell using KVO
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that in the first case, scrolling is butter smooth. But in the 2nd case (where it's reading the image directly from disk), scrolling is super jerky, even once the image is loaded. Drawing is what's causing the lag. Using Instruments, I see <code>copyImageBlockSetPNG</code>, <code>png_read_now</code> and <code>inflate</code> are taking up most of the cpu (they aren't when assigning <code>self.image</code> to <code>UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()</code>)</p>

<p>I'm assuming this happens because in the first case the UIImage is a raw output of the drawing, whereas in the second case it has to decompress the PNG every time it's drawing it. I tried using JPGs instead of PNGs and I get similar results.</p>

<p>Is there a way to fix this? Maybe to have it only decompress the PNG the first time it gets drawn?</p>

"2064","ByPass credential prompting on drive map - windows server 2k3","<p>I have 2 windows server 2k3 machines - server A and server B, Server A is on the company domain, and Server B is not.  I have a need to bypass the credential prompting that happens every time I map a drive from Server B to Server A.  The reason i need to do this is that I'm running a program called SourceAnywhere on Server A that points to a VSS database on Server B.  (SourceAnywhere solves the slowness issues that VSS http access has).  While I can configure SourceAnywhere to point to this VSS database (after mapping drive and getting access), I cannot connect to the VSS database from my development machine - i get an error saying I can access database alias..  I'm thinking this might have to do with Server B prompting me for credentials from Server A since it isn't on the domain.  Is there anyway to store these credentials?  or do i need to get Server B added to the domain?</p>

<p>Server 2003 and SQL Server 2005 runs on the same server. A process (.exe) has to be running all the time. However, sometimes I find out that this specific .exe has stopped and therefore no data was pulled from any of our branches (around 50). My phone keeps ringing, users say they can't see their records etc. </p>

<p>When I look at Server Application Logs I see attached scene. I am not sure why this happens. The user PDKS is a legitimate SQL user and I don't know why it sometimes fails to log on and most of the time runs without problems. Up until a month ago, this server was reachable from the Internet for SQL and RDP protocols (I know not ideal). I saw many different IPs that seemed to tried access by using 'brute force'. Currently the server is unreachable from the internet.</p>

<p>Any ideas why we might be getting these errors? We do take backups from this server but not always at the time this errors are thrown. For example we don't take backups in the morning. What do you think I should do?</p>
